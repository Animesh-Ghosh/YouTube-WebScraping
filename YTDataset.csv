kiNyRY5s7n8,How to Start a Travel Blog [2019] Full-Time Travel Blogger,"Create a Travel Blog Website for Just $3.95++ http://bit.ly/create-a-travel-blog-we...I've been a full-time blogger / travel vlogger for 9 years and transformed myself into a full-time travel blogger in the past 3 years. I will teach you how to create a website, build a brand and get you setup on the path to getting paid to travel. When I first started out in 2016, I didn't have a clue about how to take a decent photo and forget about shooting video. Today, I'm proud to say I'm halfway decent as a photographer and videographer and have racked up 800k followers on social and 1.5 million views on YouTube.// How Much Money Can You Make As a Travel Blogger?Since starting my travel influencer account, I've earned more than $200,000 from a combination of affiliate commission, paid sponsors, adsense and selling my own products. This is definitely a career that if you work hard and build yourself up, you can easily quit your job and live your dreams.// How to Make a Blog [2019] Focused on Travel BloggingMy advice for any new website is to use Wordpress. First of all, it's free, unlike SquareSpace which costs money to use and locks you into their hosting provider. With a Wordpress website, you can move it to any hosting provider (whether it be Bluehost or Hostgator when you first start out) or WPEngine when you really grow your blog and have a ton of traffic.// How to Start a Blog and Become a Full Time BloggerSetting up your first website should take no more than 15 minutes. Your steps are:Pick your domain nameSign up for your hosting planInstall WordpressInstall your themeStart bloggingSetup your blog here for just $3.95:++ http://bit.ly/create-a-travel-blog-we...// How to Write a Travel BlogThe really daunting task is shooting good photos and videos and telling stories as a travel blogger. I started out blogging not knowing a thing about how to shoot photos or videos but thanks to Youtube, I was able to teach myself everything I needed to learn. I suggest you do the same thing, start searching on YouTube and teach yourself.In this video, I walk you through exactly what my steps are to starting and making money with your own travel blog.I’ve tried almost every possible Monetization strategy and these are my proven methods that work for me:Affiliate marketing where you get paid a commission for selling somethingPaid advertisements like Crest paying me to review their white stripsAdsense revenue which I get from people watching this video and clicking on ads on my websiteFreelancing: taking photos, building websites or providing consulting to small businessesSelling a product: I have a style guide I created last year and it sells a couple of copies every month// my proven techniques as a full time travel blogger// find your speciality- I’ve been blogging full time for 9 years and have taught myself how to code and build sites from scratch. I’ve built websites with 12 million visitors per year, sites with just 50k visitors per month that made $50k in a month and have gone through a ton of website issues and total data losses and this expertise and experience is why I focus on teaching people how to make a website and to me the best place to start is where I started, with bluehost for just $3.95- Now you could copy my strategy, but building up your own credibility and experience will take awhile, plus you’d have to beat me at it :)- So instead, I’d suggest you focus on a product or service where you already have expertise or can build your expertise around- Say you want to be a travel blogger, what’s one thing you’ll bring on every trip that everyone needs? A great bag. Imagine you took a different bag on every trip and reviewed it as part of the vlog. I guarantee you’d be one of the few experts reviewing just bags and you’d be able to corner the market. And when you do your videos, it would be really hard for someone like me or anyone else to copy your knowledge base and expertise- Besides travel bags you could also focus on bug spray, sunscreen, backup batteries, etc find something you’re interested in and own it// This will be hard, but follow these tips to ensure you succeedIf you need any help creating your website and starting your travel vlog, let me know in the comments, I reply to every single one.// FOLLOW US: IG: https://www.instagram.com/lifetailored/Wei's IG: https://www.instagram.com/threadtherapy/Couple's IG: https://www.instagram.com/meetthewises/Web: https://lifetailored.com/// Best Vlogging Kit for BeginnersBest Starter Vlogging Camera: Canon 60D: https://fave.co/2wpomKJBest Vlogging Lens: Canon 10-22mm 3.5: https://fave.co/2MDQ807High-End 4K Camera for Photo/Video: Canon 5D Mark IV: https://fave.co/2vaPUTvHigh-End Zoom Lens for Photo/Video/B-roll: Canon 24m-70mm 2.8 II: https://fave.co/2AyMHSD",travel

Don't believe me? Come with me to the stunning Andaman and Nicobar Islands Union Territory of India. This is incredible India!We started at Kala Pathar beach which is the most beautiful and picturesque beach on Havelock Island. Then we take our scooters to the start of the 1.8km trek point to get to Elephant Beach. Elephant Beach is perfect for snorkelling and getting away from the crowded main beaches.After swimming, dancing, and snorkelling with the fish on Elephant Beach we grab lunch on the way to Radhanagar Beach - the largest and most popular beach on Havelock Island. Then I tell you one of the reasons why I love India so much, India simply has it all!Forget Goa, forget any other beach in India; the Andaman and Nicobar Islands have the best beaches I've seen in India so far! Havelock certainly has the best beaches between it and Neil Island. Neil Island is more for relaxing on the beach.In 2018 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi renamed Havelock Island to Swaraj Dweep, Ross Island to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Island, and Neil Island to Shaheed Dweep.👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇1) SUBSCRIBE! ✔ Click https://www.youtube.com/c/KarlRock/?s...Then smash the BELL ICON so you don't miss a 🔴live stream or video.2) TRAVELLING TO INDIA🇮🇳?Travel safely & confidently with my India Survival Guide (Quick-Start Safety Guide) https://indiasurvivalguide.com.3) WANT TO LEARN HINDI?Learn Hindi Faster Than I Did! eBook at https://karlrock.com.4) MEETUP LOCATIONS & ROCK NEWS Sign-up 💌 http://join.karlrock.com.5) LET'S CONNECT:https://www.instagram.com/iamkarlrock/https://www.facebook.com/iamkarlrockhttps://twitter.com/iamkarlrock📷🎥🤳 https://blog.indiasurvivalguide.com/w...#IncredibleIndia #India #Andamans #Travel #Beaches",travel

You’ll find plenty of places all over the city to indulge in both, as well as art galleries, theaters, and numerous murals that contribute to Miami’s artistic spirit.

On a higher end we would spend about 100 CUC per day on drinks, taxis, tours, food etc. It definitely adds up and goes quickly so be sure to budget!- We filled out/purchased our Visas and certification at the airport. We flew with Delta so make sure you confirm that you can do that the day of with your airline. - Download this app! Trust me it will save you in so many ways. The map on here is amazing and its all ""offline"" (Just type in ""Cuba"" in the app store on your phone and its the green one, looks like this) : https://play.google.com/store/apps/de...WHERE WE STAYED: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15752806*Amazing place. Super nice couple that rents it. They gave us a phone that works with their numbers in case and everything is super secure. Great location too! Places we went to:- Plaza De La Cathedral: This is perfect for a photo-op plus it has an inlet street with the Cafe I mentioned and a bunch of resturants- Plaza Vieja: Super pretty, definitely go here for lunch. Great views and a ton of restaurant options with live music. - Parque Central / Paseo Del Prado : This is definitely a must see! You will find the Capitol building, great hotels with rooftop views and a plethora of classic cars to look at or pick one to ride in. - Museum of Revolution : This is a great way to cool off and kill some time. It was once home to Presidents and is beyond beautiful as it was designed by Tiffany & Co.- Hotel National- This is a super fancy hotel with amazing views! We stopped to check it out as a lot of our famous favorites have stayed there. It's definitely a taxi distance away from Old Habana though. Bars:Hotel Inglaterra- This is an amazing rooftop bar with an incredible view! I had my share of sangria's here :) Floridita- One of Hemingway's must stop for a Daiquiri. I really loved these but keep in mind they are 6 CUC a piece compared to 3-4 CUC most other places.La Bodeguita De Medio- Hemingway Bar #2. This was his go-to spot for Mojitos! Beware this is a tourist trap and you might be drinking your mojito on the street depending on the time of the day. Cafe:Cafe De O'Reilly- This was our go-to for breakfast and morning coffee. Try the Cafe Bombon, it was my favorite.Dinner: La Guarida- We found this to be our favorite spot. The restaurant requires reservations, but if you forget like us, you can go up to the roof for amazing sunset views and the best food we had the whole trip! Tips:- The classic cars you see are Taxi's and cost more than the regular cars. You can however rent one for around 20 CUC for an hour city tour. Definitely worth it. Plus they make for great photos ;) - If you are staying in Old Habana, the entire area of Habana Vieja and everything I mentioned is super walkable.Not Sponsored.",travel

HA0UUANlAqo,Bali HelpX Travel blog,"Hello everyone first vlog of my travels, wanted to show what i did when i was over seas and how to save some money while traveling by moving out of your comfort zone.i used a website called HelpX which connects you with a host and you exchange your time  4 hour work day 5 days a week for a bed to sleep in and depending on your host arrangements food as well. the place i chose was TashaZarahs farm house, super laid back people and very friendly, the work was COB making which involved clay, sand and straw, at least 2 loads a day to build a wall for another room attached to the main building, but also they let you fix anything you decided needed repair or improvement.  i was able to create anything on Zarahs Farm, so i decided to start building the farm a better Sieve for their COB making and felt very rewarded and satisfied when it actually worked!! i had my doubts.spending 11 days on the farm also aloud me to explore in my free time, one main event was scuba diving with manta rays, my first time experience which was AWESOME,  you can find those beautiful creatures at the end of the video so i hope you enjoy my poorly edited video and decide to do something similar, any suggestions of where to go next leave me a comment and i'll get onto it.Woofing website: www.Helpx.netMusic:""Waterfall"" by Mogli  ""Outro"" by Mogliitunes.apple.com/au/artist/mogli/1047886186#see-all/top-songs""Bad Habits 1"" - Gavin Luke""Dazed Summer"" - Jack Elphick""Some Kind Of Magic 3"" - Niklas Gustavsson",travel

Xdya8eym9nM,"Street Food in Pakistan - ULTIMATE 16-HOUR PAKISTANI FOOD Tour in Lahore, Pakistan!","Thank you to Ali (Pakistan Travel Market): https://goo.gl/VY6NjHSUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos every week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribeT-shirts and caps: https://goo.gl/6WdK1lAlso, just published a full Pakistan travel guide: https://goo.gl/5MHgz4I’m very excited to share this first full street food in Pakistan video with you! We started our trip in Lahore, a vibrant, colorful, and packed full of food city. Our first day in Lahore turned out to be a 16 hour street food marathon in Lahore, and it was an amazing day!Get more details on my Pakistan Travel Guide: https://goo.gl/5MHgz4Sadiq Halwa Puri (https://goo.gl/maps/Yoy9dJ6steF2) - We began the day with a very common breakfast throughout Pakistan, halwa puri, but along with chana curry (chickpea curry). We ate off the car, enjoying every bit of the freshly fried puris and curry.Total price - 640 PKR ($4.78)Chacha Feeka Lassi (https://goo.gl/maps/RGQBRQaNj8p) - Next we drove over to Gawalmandi, one of the most legendary areas in Lahore for food. We headed straight to a breakfast staple, the lassi shop and had the most creamy heavy milkshake I’ve ever had, called a pera lassi.Roasted chickpeas - 25 PKR ($0.19) - After exiting an alley, right in front of us was a man selling chickpeas and corn roasted in black Himalayan salt. It’s a very common street food snack in Pakistan.Sweet potato - 80 PKR ($0.60) - Sweet potato is also a very common street food snack in Lahore, seasoned with masala and a type of citrus juice.Baba Kulfi Wala - Next we headed over to Shah Alami Market, another huge and bustling market in Lahore.Kulfi - 20 PKR ($0.15) each - One of the most famous places to eat ice cream in Lahore is Baba Kulfi Wala, and you’ll find a crowd of people standing around the corner of the road eating sticks of their famous kulfi.Orange juice - 50 PKR ($0.37)Chana chaat - 120 PKR ($0.89) per plate - One of my personal favorite Pakistani street food snacks of the day was chana chaat, a chickpea snack. He added in all sorts of spices, chutneys, and seasonings, to create a deliciously refreshing snack.Butt Karahi Tikka Restaurant - Easily one of the most well known restaurants in Lahore is Butt Karahi, specializing in curry made in a rounded pan, called a karahi (we will be eating a lot of karahi’s in Pakistan!). We ordered both a mutton karahi and chicken karahi. Both were amazing, filled with spices and butter, but the tenderness of the mutton was the winner.Total price - 5,600 PKR ($41.84)Siddique Fish Corner - You’ll notice that Lahore seems to come alive at night, and street food is everywhere at night. We began the evening with Siddique Fish Corner, one of the best fried fish stalls in Lahore. It was awesome, and so busy.Total price - 400 PKR ($2.99)Khalifa Balochi Sajji - Another Pakistani dish I wanted to try was chicken sajji, a type of hand rotisserie chicken. The atmosphere and cooking method was incredible.Total price - 390 PKR ($2.91)Khan Baba Restaurant - Finally for our last dinner on this 16 hour day of food in Pakistan, we went to one of Ali’s favorite restaurants in Lahore, Khan Baba. The goat chops were impressive as was the korma curry.Again, massive thank you to Ali, from Pakistan Travel Mart for hosting us in Pakistan, taking us around, and organizing everything.

We were lucky enough to try a winter based drink called Salep aka warm Christmas soup.The coffee machine was broken so we headed to Konotrop for some hipster Australian coffee and hipster Turkish coffee before having the craziest ice cream experience in our life!After the break we head to Sutlac Nizam Pide to try what we thought was Turkish Pizza (Pide) at least we managed to have a taste of Ayran...not sure if we regret it haha!From there we head to the Bosphorus to try Balik Ekmek and pickle juice...I have no idea where we found the room to try Borek on the way to the spice market...but not before trying some more coffee.To end it all we went to Gullouglu to have some Baklava!Thanks for watching everyone hope you enjoyed it :)Turkey Trip with Intrepid Travel (Real Turkey): http://bit.ly/intrepidtravelauWhere we get our incredible music from: http://share.epidemicsound.com/flying...

bZ7sBsE5kwA,🎥 Sri Lankan Cooking - Pol Sambol - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Vlog - Coconut Sambol,"One of several videos we filmed while in Sri Lanka, this video vlog was shot just outside Negombo. Pol sambola (coconut sambol) is a traditional Sri Lankan dish made from coconut, mostly used as an accompaniment with rice, string hoppers, hoppers, and many more meals. Sri Lankan cuisine has been shaped by many historical, cultural, and other factors. Foreign traders who brought new food items; influences from Indonesian cuisine and the cuisine of Southern India have all helped to shape Sri Lankan cuisine. Today, some of the staples of Sri Lankan cuisine are rice, coconut, and spices. The latter are used due to Sri Lanka's history as a spice producer and trading post over several centuries. Kottu is a spicy stir-fry of shredded roti bread with vegetables. Optional ingredients include eggs, meat, or cheese. It was invented in Batticaloa and literally means 'chopped roti' in Tamil. Hoppers (appam) are based on a fermented batter, usually made of rice flour and coconut milk with spices. The dish is pan-fried or steamed. The fermenting agent is palm toddy or yeast. Hopper variants can be either savory (such as egg hoppers, milk hoppers, and string hoppers), or sweet (such as vandu appa and pani appa). Kool is a seafood broth from Jaffna containing crab, fish, cuttlefish, prawns, and crayfish. It also contains long beans, jak seeds, manioc, spinach, and tamarind. The dish is thickened with palmyra root flour. ""Short eats"" are a variety of snacks that are bought by the dozen from ""short eat"" shops and restaurants. These are eaten on the go, mainly for breakfast or during the evening. Short eats include pastries, Chinese rolls and patties. A popular short eat among Tamils is the mutton roll, made from tender pieces of mutton with potato and seasoned with spices. This can be a very spicy dish. Mutton rolls are served all over the world wherever there are Sri Lankan Tamils. http://www.howtocookgreatfood.com - https://plus.google.com/+howtocookgre... - http://www.howtocookgreatethiopian.com - http://www.howtocookgreatjamaican.com - http://www.howtocookgreatcurry.com - http://www.howtocookgreatfilipino.com - https://www.facebook.com/howtocookgre... - http://www.howtocookgreatcurry.com/",travel

Subscribe to our channel: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_c...It has an exact antipodal city: Auckland, New Zealand.This small town is located 157 kilometres (98 miles) northeast of Cádiz. It has a distinctive setting along a narrow river gorge. The town extends along the course of the Rio Trejo with some houses being built into the rock walls of the gorge itself, created by enlarging natural caves or overhangs and adding an external wall.Setenil has a reputation for its meat products, particularly chorizo sausage and cerdo (pork) from pigs bred in the surrounding hills. As well as meat, it has a reputation for producing fine pasteles (pastries), and its bars and restaurants are among the best in the region.

We delve deep into neighborhoods such as Miraflores and Larcomar and offer up suggestions for travel adventure junkies such a paragliding, surfing and biking. To satisfy our taste buds we sample Peruvian cuisine including ceviche, anticuchos, salchipapas, lomo saltado, chifa, nikkei and whole lot more as part of our Lima food guide. Unfortunately, a lot of tourists skip Lima and head straight for Machu Picchu or the Amazon; however, for those who linger in Lima the reward is hanging out in the foodie capital of Latin America.

Ozi0BCzCRYw,Canary Islands Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"The Canary Islands are a Spanish archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean, just off Morocco in North Africa. Formed by volcanic eruptions and shaped by hot desert winds, they are comprised of 7 main islands.When powerful seismic forces lifted these islands out of the ocean millions of years ago, they sculpted landscapes of unimaginable beauty. So spectacular are the Canary Islands that for centuries, it was believed that this archipelago formed the peaks of the legendary lost city of Atlantis.Today, the Canary Islands are a magnet for sun seekers, beachcombers and adventurers from all over the world.With, 160 miles of coastline, 150 beaches and a climate that feels like it is always spring, the island of Fuerteventura is a perfect place to slow down and relax.A short ferry ride to the west of Fuerteventura is Gran Canaria - a place of ever changing climates and vistas.This island abounds with otherworldly landscapes that have been inspiring visitors for centuries. Take a hike to Pilancones Natural Park. The spectacular plateaus and cool ravines in this area are around 12 million years old. Tenerife, is the largest and busiest of the Canary Islands, receiving around 5 million visitors a year.Or, choose to visit Lanzarote is the Canaries’ easternmost island and is sometimes called the “Island of 100 Volcanoes.”Be humbled by Mother Nature’s destructive power on a tour of Timanfaya National Park. This region suffered a series of devastating eruptions in the 1700s and has remained largely unchanged ever since.No matter which of these magnificent islands you choose, as the sun’s molten rays merge the ocean with the earth, you’ll realise this is a place where Mother Nature and history collide.The mythical city of Atlantis may be a story, lost in the mists of time, but the Canary Islands are only a plane ride away. Whether you are searching for dramatic adventures or a sun-soaked vacation, this archipelago is alive with a powerful magic all its own.https://www.expedia.com/Canary-Island...--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Follow us on social media:Twitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia Instagram: http://instagram.com/expediaPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/Google+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Follow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: http://viewfinder.expedia.com/",travel

Today I could have gone surfing, hiking, exploring the National Park, had coffee at the market, and gone salsa dancing, but really what I needed to do was sit in a hammock and just enjoy it.  While traveling it's easy to get caught up in doing what the guidebook, or all the other travelers say you should be doing, but just like in life, you don't need to listen to that.No matter where your travels take you, remember that you don't have to fall into doing what society tells you, and you should put yourself first, especially if you ever plan on serving other people.

FXVZnPYLX8k,Langkawi | Casa Del Mar 5 Star Beach Hotel | Malaysia Luxury Travel Blog,"From the moment I caught sight of the charming architecture, the bold colours contrasting the blue sky, and my personal garden, I couldn't tell if I was Italy or Spain but somehow I was instantly transported back to the Med.  Then I turned around and my heart knew I was on the UNESCO World Geopark site of Langkawi, at the lovely Casa Del Mar.  This quaint five star hotel is home to just 34 rooms, making our stay an intimate affair where the staff remembers our usual order, knows our likes and dislikes, and instantly acts like we're part of the family.  In fact, this luxury property exudes such a chilled and relaxed vibe that I didn't fuss over how I looked once and simply relaxed throughout my entire stay.Set on the pristine Pantai Cenang beach, Casa Del Mar Langkawi is just a quick 10 minute drive from the airport and with lots of shopping and dining all around.  The cosy feeling of check-in on overstuffed sofas begins the chilled experience you'll feel throughout your stay.They have fun surprises like shelves upon shelves of books organised by language and a huge DVD library that you can simply walk up to and select what you'd like, which I did a couple of times and loved.For tons of pics and FULL REVIEW, visit my blog: http://luxurybucketlist.com/malaysia/...XOXO ~ AngelaFollow the journey:BLOGS: http://angela-carson.com  -&-  http://luxurybucketlist.comFACEBOOK: http://fb.me/AngelasExpatAdventuresINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/expatangela",travel

ieWNzZPfZzk,Rio de Janeiro Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Rio-de-Janeiro...The early morning in Rio de Janeiro brings quiet, misty coastlines and pink-purple sunrises. The Brazilian locals are up and about soon enough, piling onto the beautiful beaches and expressing themselves through artwork, dance, and the ubiquitous Rio de Janeiro partying. A Rio de Janeiro tour must stop at Christ the Redeemer, the ubiquitous statue that watches over the city from above the Tijuca National Forest. Take the cable car to the lookout point on Sugarloaf Mountain, the city’s iconic peak, and try not to look down – it’s a long way to drop!After a morning spent in nature, your Rio de Janeiro sightseeing should continue in the city proper. Join the sun worshippers at Copacabana, where you can stake out a patch of beach or float out to sea with the paddleboarders.

UvDGBIkJaqQ,"Chinese Street Food DAN DAN NOODLE Tour in Sichuan, China | INSANELY GOOD and SPICY Szechuan Noodles","One of the best Chinese street foods you will ever eat in China is the Dan Dan Noodles!  Spicy Chinese Dan Dan noodles are the best street food in China! If you love spicy Sichuan food and street food in China, then you're going to love Dan Dan noodles, because they are so flavorful and covered in a rich chili oil!In this Chinese street food video, we're bringing you on a full on Dan Dan noodle tour of Chengdu, China, DEEP in the heart of Sichuan in Southwest China. This is the land of delicious and spicy Sichuan cuisine, sometimes spelled Szechuan cuisine. There are so many famous Sichuan foods to try here in Chengdu, but today, we are trying 4 different variations of Dan Dan noodles, also sometimes called Zajiang noodles.

In my opinion, the best noodle dish in China is dan dan noodles, right here in Chengdu, Sichuan. China has some of the best street food around the world, and these dan dan noodles were INSANELY GOOD, some of the best noodles in China for sure!If you're traveling to China to eat and try different street foods, and perhaps want to learn a little bit about Chinese food and chinese cooking in the process, you need to try a few different variations of Dan Dan noodles. When they prepare the traditional Chinese dan dan noodle recipe right on the street, you can watch as they scoop the main ingredients like chili oil, soy sauce, sichuan peppercorn, and garlic right into the noodle bowl and then place the steaming hot noodles right over top. It's truly satisfying! After they put the noodles over top, they place their signature fried ground pork on top, known in Chinese as shaozi. When your dan dan noodles arrive to your table, it is very important to mix up all the chili oil and all of the ingredients throughout. This ensures that the flavour and the hot oil gets coated onto each noodle before you take a bite. It's also quite satisfying mixing the noodles and watching the dark red oil slowly turn each noodle from white into red and silky smooth. When you take your first bite, you'll understand why this is one of the BEST Chinese street foods you need to try. The spicy noodles are coated with an incredibly aromatic chili oil and really send you straight up to heaven! It's one of the best forms of Chinese cooking!

N0crXGYLYlg,23 Things To Do In Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City) Vietnam,"►Read 23 Things to do in Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City), Vietnam: http://migrationology.com/2015/06/thi...►FREE eBook: http://migrationology.com/saigon-ebook/When I was in Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City), along with eating as much Vietnamese food as I could, one of my goals was to film a travel video about some of the best things to do in Saigon. After putting together a complete list, it turned out to be 23, and I hope this list of attractions will help and inspire you to visit Vietnam’s largest and most exciting city.1. Binh Tay Market - Binh Tay Market is one of the largest wholesale distribution markets, and a perfect place to go if you’re looking to go shopping in Ho Chi Minh City. 2. Thien Hau Temple (Pagoda) - Located in Chinatown, in District 5, the temple is dedicated to Thien Hau and I really loved the sculptures and the elaborate design of the temple.3. Museum of Ho Chi Minh City - This museum offers a glimpse into the history and development of the city and Vietnam.4. Bitexco Financial Tower - This is the tallest building in Saigon, and you can either go to the Skydeck or a cafe at the top for a view of the city.5. Independence Palace (Reunification Palace) - Probably one of the most well known tourism things to do in Saigon is to visit the Independence Palace, the the former home of the president of South Vietnam during the Vietnam War.6. Saigon Cathedral of Notre Dame - With the French influence in Vietnam, the Notre Dame cathedral is a beautiful Catholic church. Attend a service or just visit. 7. Central Post Office - Designed by Gustave Eiffel, the Central Post Office in Ho Chi Minh City is an attraction mainly for its design and architecture. It’s a beautiful building.8. War Remnants Museum - Although this is not one of the happiest attractions in Saigon, it’s a place to remember and honor the horrible events that are a result of a war.9. Opera House - Right in Dong Khoi area, and there are still opera shows available.10. Dong Khoi Street - This is the height of high end shopping in Saigon.11. Saigon Zoo and Botanical Gardens - The zoo itself is not too great, but the beauty of the Saigon zoo is the botanical gardens, and the lush gardens, and taking a break from the city.12. FITO Museum (Museum of Traditional Vietnamese Medicine) - I was quite impressed by the Vietnamese medicine private museum - very interactive and educational.13. San Art Laboratory – If you love modern art, the San Art Laboratory is a great place to see and visit in Saigon.14. Turtle Lake at Night - If you’re looking for some things to do at night in Saigon, head to Turtle Lake to chill out, relax, hang out with friends, and eat snacks.15. Ben Thanh Market - One of the most famous things to do in Saigon District 1 is visit the Ben Thanh Market, one of the major central landmarks of the city.16. Phu My Hung and Starlight Bridge - Located outside of central Ho Chi Minh City, Phu My Hung is a modern development, and a great place to walk around.17. Water Puppet Show - Though originally from the north of Vietnam, water puppet shows are popular also in Saigon. I went to the Golden Dragon Water Puppet theater.18. Museum of Vietnamese History - Probably one of the most extensive and important museum showing the history of Vietnam and Ho Chi Minh City.19. Rooftop Bar - Seeing Saigon from above offers a great perspective.20. Fine Arts Museum - This was my favorite of all the museums in Saigon. The museum is housed in a well preserved building, and the art is amazing - located right in District 1 across the roundabout from Ben Thanh Market.21. Jade Emperor Pagoda - Dedicated to the Jade Emperor, the pagoda has a real ancient feel to it, and it’s worth seeing when you visit.22. Local Wet Market - One of my favorite things to do is visit a local fresh wet market, which you’ll find all over the city. The ingredients, food, and culture, all stand out at fresh markets.23. Vietnamese Street Food - By my ultimate favorite activity in Saigon is eating street food, and there are an abundance of delicious Vietnamese street foods to sample.Thank you for watching this video about the top 23 things to do in Saigon, Vietnam. I hope it has given you some great ideas to help you plan your visit. *********************************************************************Music in this video is from Audio NetworkFilmed and created by Mark Wiens and Ying Wiens: http://migrationology.com/blog & http://www.eatingthaifood.com/ & http://www.travelbyying.com/Make a donation: https://www.patreon.com/markwiensFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyTwitter: https://twitter.com/migrationologySNAPCHAT: migrationology►Get your FREE Saigon eBook: http://migrationology.com/saigon-ebook/",travel

In this travel hacking video blog I tell you how to get around booking a round trip ticket to Costa Rica to get your 90 day visa. Costa Rica has tightened their borders so expats do not overstay their visa and airplanes will not let you get on the plane without a return ticket.

In Virajpetta, we saw a small kiosk on the roadside, which was run by a Malayali. When Shaakeer told me that the shop is famous for homemade wines, I decided to try. They had many varieties of wines like grapes, pineapple, gooseberry, dates, and even bird's eye chilies.We tasted the wines, and packed some to take back home. We roamed a little in the small town of Virajpetta, before heading back to Kerala. On the way back, we had delicious Kannur special snacks and a special chukku kappi from a local tea stall.  A lot more to share with you. When we reached Mallu Traveller's house, a delicious treat was waiting for us there also.

Nowhere is life celebrated more than in the city’s nearly 700 pubs.

Its World Heritage protected Old Town is contrasted by its progressive New Town.The New Town, or La Mariscal, is centered on the bustling Plaza del Quinde and has markets, trendy cafés and nightlife. The Plaza de la Independencia is the Civic heart of Old Town, is overlooked by the Municipal Palace, Archbishop’s Palace and Presidential Palace.Quito has a wealth of ornate churches, including the Santo Domingo Church, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Basilica de la Merced, de San Francisco Church, the Church of the Society of Jesus and the Basilica of the National Vow.There are two hills that are worth exploring: Panecillo Hill is famous for its winged statue known as the “Virgin of Quito.” Itchimbia Park has a contemporary Cultural Center and panoramic city views.The nearby Pichincha Volcano was once the setting of a historic battle that resulted in Quito’s liberation from Spain. But it’s the Cotopaxi Volcano, that is the Quito’s most famous landmark.While in the area, you can’t miss the Mitad del Mundo Monument and the Intiñan Solar Museum where you walk the line of the equator and be in two hemispheres at the same time.https://www.expedia.com/Quito.d605367...--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Follow us on social media:Twitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia Instagram: http://instagram.com/expediaPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/Google+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Follow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: http://viewfinder.expedia.com/",travel

Azw7vz60zrs,The Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur Staycation Spa Weekend | Malaysia Luxury Travel Blog,"Whether you’re looking for a spa and foodie weekend ‘staycation’ or a fabulous hotel to call home during your holiday or business trip to KL, The Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur is going to be just what the doctor ordered. Located just 2 kilometres away from the iconic Petronas Towers, The Ritz is a haven of pampering for both the body and soul. Their newly renovated rooms opened only a few months ago but I swear I felt like the first guest to stay in mine (it was utterly pristine) … and with attentive butler service, I rarely wanted to leave it. Foodies will love The Ritz because you’ll find something to tempt you day or night between their five diverse restaurants and lounges, with hands-down the best jellyfish in their fine dining Cantonese restaurant Li Yen that I’ve tried in my life.Why You’ll Love The Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur:- The service! I’ve been reviewing 5-star hotels since 2011 and this is the first time I’ve listed ‘service’ as the #1 love but it’s true. It doesn’t matter where I go in the hotel, because I’ve been here a couple of times before (for afternoon tea and once for Sunday brunch) the staff not only knows what I like and brings it without asking but they all magically seem to greet me by name – I love that!- The 1-bedroom suites are bright and modern and so absolutely perfect you'll want to stay IN on this visit to KL.- The food!  Lordy, lordy the fooooood!  I ate so much, and so well, that I left with a couple extra kilos I'm sure.  Don't miss their afternoon tea (my #1 favourite of the big hotels so far in Kuala Lumpur) or the Menu Du Jour for dinner in The Library, it was my favourite meal of the weekend.- Champagne 'Sunday Roast' Brunch!  It's a grown up brunch, without donuts or waffle stations, and it's scrumptious.For 90+ pics and a full review, visit my blog Luxury Bucket List: http://luxurybucketlist.com/malaysia/...XOXO ~ AngelaFollow the journey:BLOGS: http://ExpatAngela.com  -&-  http://luxurybucketlist.comFACEBOOK: http://fb.me/AngelasExpatAdventuresINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/expatangela",travel

hZbhALpp3qo,How To Find a Niche For Your Travel Blog or Instagram,"How To Find a Niche For Your Travel Blog or InstagramWhen you think of your job as a travel blogger, it's ultimately to provide value to your readers. It's normal human behavior to want to talk about lots of different topics, but in order to be a successful travel blogger or influencer, you need to consider perfecting your niche. Think of all the successful travel bloggers you love and look up to. Are they talking about tons of different topic, or really zoning in on a few in particular? 9/10 - they have travel as the umbrella, but are focusing on 2 or 3 sub niches (adventure, culinary, motivation)If you're using SEO tactics to drive traffic to your blog, you want to ensure that the person that comes to your blog for the first time, knows what to expect. If you have posts on motherhood, travel, fitness and fashion, you will most likely lose them as a loyal follower. While they may be interested in all these topics, they found your site via search, and are looking for more topics that cover this area. In today's video, I'll talk more about why getting niche will transform your travel blog or instagram, and tactics on how to get started!Relevant Blog Post: https://sidewalkerdaily.com/travel-bl...::::::Sidewalker Daily is committed to bridging the gap between travel brands and content creators by providing unparalleled support and educational resources on best industry practices.

9FhhHe2eay8,Singapore | Marina Mandarin Executive Club | Asia Luxury Travel Blog,"When it comes to Marina Mandarin Singapore by Meritus, you definitely can't judge a book by its cover.  The outside of the building is unassuming, leaving us insanely unprepared for the jaw-dropping awe you'll experience stepping through into the beating heart of this lovely property.  If you're lucky enough to arrive during the day, you'll be greeted by songbirds whose tunes echo throughout the hotel because all 21 floors open onto an immense atrium.  The staff are friendly and charmingly dressed, the rooms are large, and if you couldn't imagine staying in Singapore and not having the best view ... well, you're in luck because Club Rooms like mine come with a balcony and that iconic view of Marina Bay.Why You'll Love Marina Mandarin Singapore:-- Dim Sum Lunch at Peach Blossoms - the restaurant serves up some of the most diverse and inventive dim sum dishes that I've seen in Singapore.  There's a set all-inclusive menu and an à la carte menu with some really interesting extras like lobster and foie.  OHHH and my favourite part is that they serve bottles of Champagne and have a fab list of sakes and wines, which is not common at most dim sum lunch hotspots. -- The Views!  Come on, we all want that stunning skyline view of Singapore and Mandarin Orchard has the best view of Marina Bay Sands and the areas around it, including the ferris wheel.  Just wait 'til you see it at night.-- Meritus Club Lounge - I've been a huge fan of Meritus Club since I first stayed at Meritus Pelangi Beach Resort on Langkawi last year but Marina Mandarin really stands out.  They basically won my heart by serving Moët & Chandon champagne and some of the most interesting cheeses during the Club's happy hour!For TIPS, my full write up and review and 40+ pics, visit my travel blog: http://luxurybucketlist.com/destinati...XOXO ~ AngelaFollow the Journey:BLOGS: http://ExpatAngela.com  -&-  http://luxurybucketlist.comFACEBOOK: http://fb.me/AngelasExpatAdventuresINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/expatangela",travel

xq2UYBD00us,Langkawi | SkyBridge & Glass Bottom CableCar | Malaysia Luxury Travel Blog,"Glass bottomed cable cars, panoramic views, and a terrifying glass window you can stand on hundreds of feet above ground ... well, those are just three reasons that the Langkawi SkyBridge and SkyCar experience is definitely the biggest and best 'must do and see' activity on Langkawi.  Opened in February 2005, the main boarding station for the gondola-style cable cars is located at the foothills of the picturesque Machincang mountain, said to be on a part of Southeast Asia that is the most ancient and the first to have emerged from the sea.The SkyBridge is the longest 'free span' and curved bridge in the world and it's exciting just to be standing on it!  I had a challenging but fabulous time as you'll see from the video :-)3 Tips for the Best Langkawi SkyBridge and SkyCab Experience:1 - Ride in the glass bottomed cable car!  Although the VIP gondolas are pretty cool with music, food & drinks, and only 3 comfy seats per car, I prefer the 95 Ringgit glass bottom SkyCabs for their roomy feel and amazing views.  Don't even consider the normal SkyCab, trust me on this one.2 - Opt for the SkyGlide!  To go from the top station to the SkyBridge in just a few seconds, riding on the SkyGlide is a breeze and only an extra 10 Ringgits.  Otherwise you have 12 minutes of stairs up and back.3 - Take off your shoes!  As you walk along Langkawi's SkyBridge you'll notice that a few of the floor panels are made of glass, giving you a birds-eye view of the canyon below.  For some reason, the feeling of standing on that was one of the scariest things I've done in AGES!  It's truly spine chilling but absolutely worth it.  It's one of my favourite memories of the SkyBridge for some reason.

If you're a relatively new travel blogger or writer, then this course will help fill you up with inspiration and actionable tasks to fill up your editorial calendar. Learn more here: http://skl.sh/1Tt6sf9You don’t have to travel 365 days a year to be a travel blogger. Yup, seriously.There are plenty of travel bloggers who enjoy a job that keeps them in one city most of the year...they prefer living close to family members...they are sorting out finances before making a move...or they only have 2 weeks of vacation a year. (Sound familiar? Sign up for the entire course here: http://skl.sh/1Tt6sf9)Whether you aspire to one day travel every day of the year or you simply enjoy travel writing as a hobby, how can you successfully blog about travel when you’re not traveling? It’s a unique form of writer’s block to feel like you have no experiences or travel stories to write about simply because it’s been a little while since your last trip. But to be even remotely successful at travel blogging, you also have to be consistently publishing content. What’s a travel blogger to do?Well, I’m here to help you kick that writer’s block's ass and get content and posts queued up in your editorial calendar. By the end of this course, you will have a plethora of different types of posts to create and different brainstorming techniques so that you can write regular content for your blog, no matter how much you travel. You simply have to know how to dig up that content and use it in the best way possible.",travel

6BoYfs2I0r8,How I make money while traveling the world (and eating),"►How to Start a Travel Blog: https://migrationology.com/how-to-sta...►How to Make Money While Traveling: https://migrationology.com/how-to-mak...The number one question I get asked is how I can afford to travel, while making money, and blogging. I'm going to answer how I make money, and also how I can afford to travel and eat in this video. Also, I'll share how I think you can do it too!There are many many ways to make money while traveling, and I have friends that are working on cruise ships, blogging, affiliate marketing, freelance writing, and even skydiving, while earning money to be able to maintain a lifestyle traveling. But instead of sharing all the ways on how to make money traveling, I'll first share the ways I make money.First I want to say that all of these ways that I make money while traveling are all the result of initially starting a blog back in 2009 and committing to writing quality and useful information on it on a regular basis. If you want to make money while traveling, I'd highly recommend you start a blog on whatever you're passionate about and begin blogging high quality useful information to show your expertise, and also connecting with others. (If you're just starting a travel blog, Travel Blog Success is an excellent course that I recommend: https://travelblogsuccess.com/?ref=18 [affiliate])1. Affiliate recommendations - This basically means earning a small commission as a referral. There are many companies (places like Amazon and Agoda.com for hotels) that offer a commission if you refer someone to a purchase. As an example, on my website I give away a lot of free useful tips about visiting Bangkok (http://migrationology.com/bangkok-tha...). And I also recommend a few hotels which, some of which I've previously stayed at, and others which I've just visit and highly recommend. So if you were to click one of the links and book that hotel, I would get a small commission as a referral. I only recommend things that I use myself or trust.2. My premium travel and food guides - The biggest way I make money while traveling is by selling my premium travel and food guides (http://migrationology.com/travel-guides/). Right now I have the Bangkok 101 things to do guide, Eating Thai Food Guide, Vegetarian Thai Food Guide, and the Delhi travel guide, and I'm working on more. I prefer to sell my own guides than doing advertising on my website, because I can trust in the quality of my own guides.3. Freelance writing - As a result of first starting my travel blog back in 2009, I've had the opportunity to do numerous freelance writing projects, some big and some small. I've written for a few inflight magazines, as well as CNN Travel, and various other newspapers, magazines, and websites. I used to dislike writing, but the more I started blogging about thing I really enjoyed (like food) the more I enjoyed it. And after committing to it and blogging, I've been able to connect with so many others and had chances to write for many places. A blog is a great way for you to have a public profile of your expertise.4. Video, YouTube - Finally, the fourth way of how I make money while traveling and blogging is through videos. I made the decision to start making videos and I have committed to it. Ads on some of my videos is another chunk of my monthly income.Along with how to make money while traveling and blogging, it's also important to say how I can afford to travel? Most of the money my wife and I make now goes back into our traveling and eating. However, it's all about your priorities. We don't own a car and pay for gas, and instead we choose to buy plane tickets and eat street food. You have to set your own goals and priorities and live intentionally to pursue them.Mentioned in the video:My travel guides: http://migrationology.com/travel-guides/My travel resources: http://migrationology.com/travel-reso...Learn to make a succesful travel blog (especially recommended if you're starting out): https://travelblogsuccess.com/?ref=18 [affiliate]Getting a job on a cruise ship: https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?...

N3ISUUO0CSo,St. Petersburg Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Four hundred miles west of Moscow is St. Petersburg, Russia. A striking city resting on the banks of the Neva River, St. Petersburg has long been a draw for lovers of architecture, as St. Petersburg tours often begin with the city's legendary structures.Enter a world of towering cathedrals, palaces, and gardens, many of them set down by the order of Peter the Great in the 18th century. As the decades passed, later members of Russian royalty added to the city's opulence by constructing additional marvels. Walk through the Palace Square, located in the heart of St. Petersburg and home of the Winter Palace, the sprawling home of Catherine the Great. Next, pay a visit to St. Isaac's Cathedral and its gold-plated dome, which glitters in the sunshine. If you walk to the top of its dome, you will be rewarded with astonishing views of the city.Continue your St. Petersburg sightseeing by taking a boat ride down the river to Peterhof Gardens & Palace. This gilded structure and its lush array of plant life was constructed to rival France's Palace of Versailles, and is a popular place for a quiet walk in nature or to reflect upon the engineering marvel of its 60 fountains, all of which flow continuously without the use of pumps.

06T2kabkL7E,Top Places in France: Alsace | Expedia Viewfinder Travel Blog,"Alsace is a famous region in north eastern France that’s been producing wine for centuries. Lauren LeBrun from the Expedia Viewfinder blog shows us why it’s one of the best areas in France for wine tasting and village hopping. The region stretches across 40,000 acres and more than 100 villages. Riquewihr is a town in central Alsace that dates back to medieval times. Being there makes you feel like you’ve traveled back in time! Walk down the cobblestone streets and you’ll see timber-framed, brightly-painted buildings. The architecture has been carefully preserved throughout the centuries, so it appears almost identical to how it looked in the 1500s. The town is packed with restaurants, shops, and wine tasting rooms. Here you’ll find local favorites such as tarte flambée, French crepes, and fragrant cheeses. But one of the main reasons why people visit Alsace is to wine taste. The region is known for its Riesling wines, which are actually drier than other Rieslings produced around the world. Go to any village on the Alsace wine route and you’ll be able to taste a variety of wines from family owned vineyards. If you love food, wine, and charming villages, then Alsace is the perfect place for you.

It is crossed by the Mincio river.The economy is mostly based on agriculture, with some craftwork and industrial production.History:Archaeological excavations in the Mincio valley include a Bronze Age settlements, some tombs dating to the Iron Age and some findings associated with the Etruscan civilization. A large Celtic necropolis, found in 1984 still partly buried under the current town, would prove the presence of that people from the 4th century AC and the 1st century DC.The creation of the villages of Valeggio and Borghetto dates to the Lombard rule in northern Italy. The monastery of Santa Maria was founded here, on the Mincio shore, was founded here in the 12th century; later it was a priory of the Knights Templar. The large medieval fortifications which characterize Valeggio (Scaliger castle, the Visconti Bridge and the Serraglio difensive line) were built between the 13th and the 14th centuries. In 1405 Valeggio became part of the Republic of Venice, and subsequently lost its strategic role, becoming an agricultural center and a silkworms trading market.After the fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797, Valeggio was included in the Cisalpine Republic. Later it was part of the Italian Republic (1802-1805) and, after some decades under the Austrian rule, of the newly unified Kingdom of Italy.Tags: #Travel #TravelBlog #TravelBlogger #TravelGuide #Tourism #Italy #Veneto #Verona #LakeGarda #Borghi #Borghetto #BorghettosulMincio #Valeggio #ValeggiosulMincio #Italia #TouristGuide #Guide #Turismo #Tourisme",travel
JUJ9b-8fOzQ,🎥 Sri Lankan Cooking - Traditional Kitchen - Coconut Roti - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Vlog,"🎥 Sri Lankan Cooking - Traditional Kitchen - Coconut Roti - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Vlog - One of several videos we filmed while in Sri Lanka, this video vlog was shot just outside Negombo. Pol sambola (coconut sambol) is a traditional Sri Lankan dish made from coconut, mostly used as an accompaniment with rice, string hoppers, hoppers, and many more meals. Sri Lankan cuisine has been shaped by many historical, cultural, and other factors. Foreign traders who brought new food items; influences from Indonesian cuisine and the cuisine of Southern India have all helped to shape Sri Lankan cuisine. Today, some of the staples of Sri Lankan cuisine are rice, coconut, and spices. The latter are used due to Sri Lanka's history as a spice producer and trading post over several centuries. Kottu is a spicy stir-fry of shredded roti bread with vegetables. Optional ingredients include eggs, meat, or cheese. It was invented in Batticaloa and literally means 'chopped roti' in Tamil. Hoppers (appam) are based on a fermented batter, usually made of rice flour and coconut milk with spices. The dish is pan-fried or steamed. The fermenting agent is palm toddy or yeast. Hopper variants can be either savory (such as egg hoppers, milk hoppers, and string hoppers), or sweet (such as vandu appa and pani appa). Kool is a seafood broth from Jaffna containing crab, fish, cuttlefish, prawns, and crayfish. It also contains long beans, jak seeds, manioc, spinach, and tamarind. The dish is thickened with palmyra root flour. ""Short eats"" are a variety of snacks that are bought by the dozen from ""short eat"" shops and restaurants. These are eaten on the go, mainly for breakfast or during the evening. Short eats include pastries, Chinese rolls and patties. A popular short eat among Tamils is the mutton roll, made from tender pieces of mutton with potato and seasoned with spices. This can be a very spicy dish. Mutton rolls are served all over the world wherever there are Sri Lankan Tamils. http://www.howtocookgreatfood.com - https://plus.google.com/+howtocookgre... - http://www.howtocookgreatethiopian.com - http://www.howtocookgreatjamaican.com - http://www.howtocookgreatcurry.com - http://www.howtocookgreatfilipino.com - https://www.facebook.com/howtocookgre... - http://www.howtocookgreatcurry.com/ - Roti (also known as chapati) is a flatbread originating from the Indian subcontinent, made from stoneground wholemeal flour, traditionally known as atta, that originated and is consumed in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Maldives, Malaysia and Bangladesh. It is also consumed in parts of South Africa, Fiji, Mauritius, the southern Caribbean, particularly in Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Grenada, Barbados and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Its defining characteristic is that it is unleavened. Indian naan bread, by contrast, is a yeast-leavened bread. A kulcha in Indian cuisine is a bread-like accompaniment, made of processed flour (maida) leavened with yeast. The word roti is derived from the Sanskrit word रोटिका (roṭikā), meaning ""bread"".[4] Names in other languages are Hindi: रोटी; Assamese: ৰুটী; Nepali : रोटी; Bengali: রুটি; Sinhalese: රොටි; Gujarati: રોટલી; Marathi: पोळी; Odia: ରୁଟି; Malayalam: റൊട്ടി; Kannada: ರೊಟ್ಟಿ; Telugu: రొట్టి; Tamil: ரொட்டி; Urdu: روٹی‎; Punjabi: ਰੋਟੀ,ਫੂਲਕਾ; Thai: โรตี. It is also known as maani in Sindhi, ruti in Bengali and phulka in Punjabi and Saraiki. In Sri Lanka, probably the most popular type of roti is pol roti (coconut roti), made of wheat flour, kurakkan flour, or a mixture of both, and scraped coconut. Sometimes, chopped green chillies and onion are added to the mixture before cooking. These are usually thicker and harder than other roti types. They are usually eaten with curries, or some types of sambol or lunu miris and considered a main meal rather than a supplement. Another variety of roti popular in Sri Lanka is Kottu roti. Kottu roti is made up of paratha or godamba roti . Paratha/godamba roti is cut into small pieces. These pieces are small in size and rectangular or square in shape. Then on a square heating pan, vegetables, onions are allowed to be fried. Then eggs, cooked meat or fish are added to fried vegetables and allowed to be heated for a few minutes. Finally the pieces of cut paratha is added. All these ingredients are mixed using two square pieces of steel. A peculiar sound is deliberately made while the mixing is done[citation needed]. It is said that the first person who innovated kottu roti to save the remaining paratha at his restaurant made this noise to attract patrons to make them aware of the new delicacy[citation needed]. Depending upon what ingredients are used, there are vegetable, egg, chicken, beef, mutton and fish kottu roti.",travel

uTiF5grxxCs,Kollur Mookambika temple darshanam  ಕೊಲ್ಲೂರು ಮೂಕಾಂಬಿಕಾ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನ LIVE Karnataka travel blog,"The Kollur Mookambika Temple/ ಕೊಲ್ಲೂರು ಮೂಕಾಂಬಿಕಾ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನ at Kollur, Udupi District in the state of Karnataka, India, is a Hindu temple dedicated to mother parvati Devi known as Mookambika Devi. Mookambika is Shakthi devi, the supreme mother goddess in Hinduism. She is worshipped in three different forms such as Maha Kali (goddess of power) in the morning, Maha Lakshmi (goddess of wealth) in the noon and Maha Saraswati (goddess of knowledge) in the evening. There are bus train services from Byndoor Udupi and Mangalore to Kollur at regular interval.Mythology holds that at the Kollur Mookambika Temple lived a demon named Kaumasura, who unleashed terror upon the gods by the special powers he obtained from Lord Brahma. While the gods were trying their best to stay away from him, good news came that the demon would face death. Learning of his impending doom, Kaumasura undertook severe penance. Lord Shiva appeared, asking the demon what boon he would like to be granted. Sensing that grave danger would come of the demon if his boon was granted, Saraswati, the goddess of speech took away his ability to speak. Kaumasura came to be known as Mookasura or the mute demon. Thereafter, the supreme mother parvati devi, the goddess of power, mobilized all the powers of the gods and killed the demon, and hence she came to be known as Mookambika. The place where Mookambika killed the demon came to be known as Marana Katte.The establishment of the Mookambika temple is attributed to the Supreme, Lord Parameshwara sadashiva, rather than to an individual person. Historically, the temple is estimated to be at least 1200 years old and is mentioned in conjunction with king Halugallu Veera Sangayya who installed an idol there.As a legend goes, Adi Shankara, the much revered spiritual leader from Kerala, once offered intense worship to Saraswati, the goddess of wisdom and learning. The goddess appeared before Shankara in response to his prayers. Shankara told her of his wish to have her come along with him to Kerala, where no temple was dedicated to her as yet. Goddess Saraswati agreed to go with him on the condition that Shankara must lead the way for her to follow, without doubting her and not looking back even once to check if she was with him. Should he break the condition, she would stop and stay right where she was at the time. Shankara agreed to the condition. So they started walking down the Kodachadri hills, with Shankara leading the way and goddess’ anklets tinkling and letting him know that she was with him. After walking some distance, the tinkling stopped all of a sudden. Shankara waited a few moments and stole a quick look backwards to find the goddess still with him, watching him with reproach. In keeping with the condition, the goddess stopped right there. Shankara, however, was not one to give up. He apologized profusely for breaking the condition and repeatedly begged and pleaded with the goddess to go with him to Kerala. Impressed by his determination, the goddess finally agreed to be present at the Chottanikkara Temple in Kerala in the mornings and return to the Mookambika temple by mid-day.",travel

This one is about our train trip from Jakarta to Yogyakarta. As you already know, our budget is more than limited, so we decided to buy the cheapest tickets. We were surprised that traveling vy train in Indonesia (Java Island) is much more expensive than traveling by train in Thailand.

Even though science and technology has advanced so much in cars, electronics, satellite communication etc, we still face difficulties in managing vehicle transport on road. Today after some scientific research and investigation on this topic we found a few solutions to this. Analysis of real life case studies of certain technology such as Artemis of Japan which was also funded in Vietnam by Jica and the concept of self driving cars made possible by Google, Tesla and General motors can help us out a lot with the congestion.

Access to energy resources will influence and shape the future of human society as we go forward. The cost and availability of energy significantly impacts our quality of life. While most people in industrialized countries have easy access to energy more than two billion people are still relying on solid fuels like wood for cooking and heating. There are also environmental issues to be considered in our efforts for exploration and utilization of new sources of energy. Microwave remote sensing techniques have been very successful for measuring and monitoring many environmentally important terrestrial parameters such as soil moisture, biomass, ocean wind and salinity, etc. However, until recently such techniques have not been exploited for subsurface sensing. In this talk a number of recently developed radar remote sensing techniques will be presented to demonstrate the potential of microwave remote sensing techniques in exploration of fossil fuel resources. A dual frequency synthetic aperture technique will be presented that allows for mapping the sand layer thickness over bedrock to assist with successful seismic tests. Also, a borehole subsurface synthetic aperture imaging concept is presented that facilitates mapping the extent of the subsurface fracking region in shell rock. Monitoring the extent of fracking region is of great importance for optimal utilization of oil/gas wells and to ensure the fracking region is far away from the aquafers.For more lectures on demand visit:http://www.engin.umich.edu/college/in...",science

dbo_wbfRZm0,25 Modern Science And Technologies You'd Swear Are Science Fiction,"It’s an undeniable fact that the newest technologies such as mobile tech, genetic engineering, and the emerging field of nanotech differ from the technologies that preceded them in a fundamental way. Our world is transforming rapidly and violently to the point where many people feel completely unable to comprehend and utilize these advancements. Ironically, we witnessed many of these new “things” and technologies in sci-fi films and graphic comics first, and if someone had told us back then that it would only take a couple of decades for these changes to enter our lives, we would have probably laughed.  Think about it: Back in the early ’90s emerging computer technology was used by a limited number of people worldwide, and now, a quarter century later, everyone has a smartphone and a laptop. Can you even imagine what the world will look like in 2030, even 2050? And the scariest part of all (especially if you’re a geek like me) is the fact that science fiction, the literature of the human species encountering vast, mind-altering changes, whether they arrive via scientific discoveries, technological innovations, natural events, aliens, or societal shifts, has recently lost its magic and glimpse to the point we wonder what is real and what is not nowadays. But if you think we’re being over-dramatic, then check out these 25 Modern Science And Technologies You'd Swear Are Science Fiction and you will see we’re not exaggerating at all.Follow us on:Twitter: https://twitter.com/list25Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/list25Website: http://list25.comInstagram: https://instagram.com/list25/Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/list25/Check out the physical list here: http://list25.com/25-modern-science-a...Voice control is now a trend The Cancer Gene FingerprintRobot snake automatically wraps around an object when thrownFlying carsFirst planet with FOUR suns discoveredNASA begins using robotic exoskeletonsDiamond planet discoveredArtificial leaves generate electricityVoyager I leaves the Solar SystemSelf-Driving bus is legal in Greece3-D printer creates full-size houses in one sessionDNA was photographed for the first timeGenetically modified silk is stronger than steelDARPA robot can traverse an obstacle courseLaser guns are now a realityEye implants give sight to the blindQuadriplegic successfully uses mind-controlled robotic armYou can swallow a pill-sized camera instead of invasive scopesinFORM 3-D display allows remote manipulation of physical objectsEngineers create a paper-thin robot skin that responds to touchScientists create Matrix-esque artificial wombHuman brain is hackedInvisibility cloak technology took a huge leap forwardSuperman’s view through walls becomes realityThe world’s first fully mind-controlled synthetic leg goes for a stroll",science

OfdjeCwaD-s,"Julio M. Ottino: How Art, Science, and Technology Separated (and May Join Again)","Julio M. Ottino, dean of the McCormick School of Engineering at Northwestern University, speaks to the Northwestern University Women's Board.Abstract:There was a time before science and technology were known by those names. Art, technology, and science formed a continuum, and the modes of thinking enriched each other. The 16th century has many examples of cooperative enterprises between scientists and artists; Galileo Galilei may be clearest case of Italian Renaissance art affecting the course of science. Galileo is also associated with birth of the scientific method, and the scientific method changed everything: science broke company with art, and mixing imagery with analytical thinking became suspect (at least by some). This view is far too narrow -- visual imagination is a central element of scientific imagination. This talk will cover the links between art, technology, and science through time, starting when people had a foot in two camps and when new technologies appeared and the scientific basics of those technologies were still evolving, until reaching examples of the present time. It closes with lessons that can be transferred across domains.",science

h4yP_Ltc97E,Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology,"The project to establish the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology was first announced in June 2001 by the Minister of State for Okinawa and Northern Territories Affairs and the Minister of State for Science and Technology Policy. The Japanese Cabinet Office promotes the project with the following three objectives:Firstly, to establish in Japan a leading center for research and education that will address new challenges in science and technology. Having achieved economic development through technological innovation, Japan is keen to make significant contributions to the advancement of science and technology. Today, many emerging fields of science and technology require multidisciplinary research. The Institute will focus on integrative approaches to high level research and education. Secondly, to provide a successful model of a research university for Japanese academia. Existing universities with rigid departmental structures face difficulties in developing new systems to accommodate integrative research and education. An additional challenge is to establish a fully internationalized environment. Aside from the Institute holding lectures in English, the Institute will encourage the use of English as the working language of the graduate university. It is hoped that the infusion of differing cultural mindsets will develop a creative atmosphere that nurtures an original and questing spirit.Thirdly, to stimulate the economic transformation of Okinawa. As Okinawa moves beyond the 30th anniversary of Reversion to Japan (2002), the need to develop a self-sustaining, private-sector-driven economy is clear. As an integral step in this process, the Institute aims jump start the development of an industrial and technological cluster. Okinawa's beautiful natural surroundings and geographical proximity to several East-Asian metropolis provide an ideal setting for a world-class university.",science

FRQnL2IWCXk,Fifty Years of Chinese Science and Technology,"Prof. Geoff Oldham reflects on his experiences over fifty years, starting with this first visit to the Chinese mainland in October 1964 when he wrote in Science magazine of “the beginning of the Chinese scientific revolution”. He recalls decades of collaborative work between SPRU and Chinese institutions through the 1970s and 80s, including research conducted on technology transfer in the oil industry and in the area of ‘clean coal technologies’, links between provincial level research and policy making, and his contributions to policy evaluations in the 1980s and 1990s that saw him working alongside Chinese and international colleagues and reporting directly to the Minister of Science and Technology. Tracing China’s changing science and technology policies from the early focus on self-reliance to the ‘catching up’ of the reform and opening period that paved the way for China’s emerging leadership and current patterns of international collaboration, his talk charts the country’s ongoing transformation and the changing role of science and technology within it. It alsos provide an account reflecting on personal memories that have shaped Professor Oldham’s perspectives on this process.

af_qq-hX3QM,College Experience Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)  Part 1 of 2,"Click on this link to hear the experience of a student studying at full scholarship in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) pursuing mechanical Engineering. Watch this chat show as Part 1 of 2 videos.Ansh Nasta of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology talks on Chet Chat. Ansh is studying on a full scholarship and is pursuing mechanical engineering. He shares the experience of studying at HKUST.HKUST has modern buildings, it has a very modern large campus, compared to the other Asian universities like NTU, HKU. It has a beautiful campus, right next to the sea so they enjoy both the hilly aspect as well as the seas side aspect. They have a small beach on campus too. They play soccer on the field which is right next to the sea, they sometimes have to jump in and fetch the ball. The residence halls are facing the sea as well, half of them. There are about 2000 students in each year, including 800 students in the Engineering School.One of the big advantages of studying at HKUST is the low cost. HKUST offers many scholarships to students. It doesn’t matter whether you have done IB, ICSE or CBSE, everyone can get a scholarship, only the amounts vary depending upon your grade 11 and Grade 12 marks. There is a page on the website devoted to scholarships for IB students. If you get over 35 out of 45 points in IB you are eligible for a scholarship. If you apply early, a 42 gives you a full scholarship and if you apply regular a 45 gets you a scholarship.The cost is around HKD 120,000 for international students and HKD 40,000 for local students. The government funds each child, whether they are local or international. Even the living costs are very low in Hong Kong – approx. HKD 15,000 – 20,000 per year which is very low.Mechanical Engineering is a tough program. It has an intense workload and courses are offered only once a year so you have to plan your courses in a way that you do not have to take an extra semester at the end of the four years. Mechanical Engineering has the most number of required credits as compared to other degrees.  You need to do 15 credits a semester to complete your requirements. And extra courses if you want to do a minor. Ansh intends to do a minor in business. The mechanical department offers options, you can do three courses in one area to call that your option, he is doing an option in in sustainable energy. There is a lot of flexibility allowed. HKUST has a core requirement of 36 courses out of the required 120. These include math, comp science, history, science and technology – any field or any major. The course allows you to take any course as long as you fulfil the requirements of that course.Ansh enjoyed a course in history in his first year and last summer he took a course in bitcoins that he thoroughly enjoyed. That was his favourite class. Discussion based class with external speakers was interesting.The activities that he is engaged in outside the classroom are diverse – he is the financial secretary of the art club, the internal secretary of the cuisine society.  He works with the sustainability unit, as part of the sustainability leadership program at his school he is working on a solar panel project and is now a mentor for students pursuing projects in sustainable energy. He also trains with the school track and field team and runs long distance running like 5 kms and cross country. He also plays football for the mech engineering team. He tries lots of new sports like kickboxing. HKUST has an Undergraduate research orientation program which is considered one of the best in Asia. They have a lot of funding from the government and infrastructure available to do research. Ansh has been pursuing research for the past one year under a professor on Energy harvesting.HKUST (UST) has really good sport infrastructure too, they have a football field, running track near the sea, an indoor football court too, 8 tennis courts, squash courts, badminton courts, indoor gym, table tennis tables, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, multi purpose hall for martial arts.  Student body is international compared to the Asian universities. 80% of the students are local Hong Kong students since it is government funded, 10% are mainland china students. 10% of the student body is international. This largely includes Philipines, Indonesia, Taiwan, Korea, India students but in recent years they have had lots of Europeans and Americans coming in for the experience.

zO3HZdejf_U,Science & Technology Policy Fellows: Transforming Global Science,"Over the past 40 years, AAAS S&T Policy Fellows have gone on to top leadership posts in U.S. science policy. In a new video, several alumni discuss the program's global impact. In the early 1970s, science-related issues emerged at the center of public debate and at the top of the U.S. political agenda: water and air pollution, energy and nuclear power, the future of the space program. And yet leaders in the U.S. science community, including some at AAAS, realized that Congress and other policy agencies lacked the scientific expertise that would be essential in addressing these issues.To fill the need, they established the AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellowships, and in 1973, seven select scientists and engineers—the first class of Fellows—were dispatched to congressional offices. Over the next four decades, each new year brought a new and bigger class of Fellows. As the years have passed, alumni have risen to high-impact positions in Congress, the White House, the State Department, federal agencies, research universities, and non-governmental organizations.

lATa1bdU3Ec,President Obama Stresses Importance of Science and Technology to the Nation's Future,"On April 29, 2013 -  President Barack Obama reiterated his strong support for science and technology in this speech to members of the National Academy of Sciences at its 150th annual meeting. Science, technology, engineering, and medicine are critical to the nation's prosperity, Obama said, noting that investments made today are bound to pay off for many years to come. The president warned that recent mandatory cuts in federal spending could slow these critical advances in research.  ""With the pace of technological innovation today, we can't afford to stand still for a year or two years or three years,"" Obama said. ""We've got to seize every opportunity we have to stay ahead, and we can't let other countries win the race for ideas and technology of the future."" Just as science and technology have advanced the nation in the past, he noted, they will be critical in addressing today's challenges. ""We will continue to pursue advances in science, engineering, infrastructure, education, and environmental protection, and especially science-based innovations to help us minimize and adapt to global threats like climate change,"" Obama said.President Obama made an impassioned plea to ensure that the nation's young people continue to maintain their spirit of discovery and receive strong educations in STEM.  ""We don't want our kids just to be consumers of the amazing things that science generates,"" Obama said. ""We want them to be producers as well.  We've got to make sure we're supporting that next generation of dreamers and risk takers."" Since Abraham Lincoln signed the congressional charter founding the National Academy of Sciences 150 years ago, the Academy has played a critical role in advancing science and shaping public policy. ""[Lincoln] recognized that finding a way to harness the highest caliber scientific advice for the government would serve a whole range of long-term goals for the nation,"" Obama said, noting that his administration turns to the Academy for advice on many issues.""Like President Lincoln 150 years ago, President Obama clearly understands the importance of S&T to the future prosperity and security of our nation,"" said NAS President Ralph J. Cicerone in introductory remarks. ""We're pleased that President Obama and the administration continue to turn to the National Academy of Sciences for help, analysis, and advice on many issues facing the nation and the world today.""President Obama is the only president to address the National Academy of Sciences' annual gatherings of members twice; he also spoke at the 2009 NAS annual meeting. Other presidents who have addressed the NAS include George H.W. Bush in 1990, John F. Kennedy, who spoke at the NAS Centennial Convocation in 1963 and at the NAS annual meeting in 1961, Jimmy Carter in 1979, and Calvin Coolidge in 1924.The National Academy of Sciences is a private, nonprofit institution that was established under a congressional charter signed by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863. It recognizes achievement in science by election to membership, and -- with the National Academy of Engineering, Institute of Medicine, and National Research Council -- provides science, technology, and health policy advice to the federal government and other organizations.",science
pRDlSiJVP9o,The Revolution of Science & Technology Since 1945,"Science and Tech Since 1945Have you ever watched a cartoon snowball roll down a hill? It usually picks up snow on its way down, getting larger and larger, before inevitably running over someone. In many ways, the advancement of science and technology since World War II (WWII) has acted a lot like that snowball - out of a few small technological developments and breakthroughs has come even more innovation and new devices which seem to come to market at a faster pace every day. It's how we can go from adding machines the size of an apartment to handheld computers in barely a half century. This lesson will detail some of these mind-boggling advances in the world of science and technology since WWII.CommunicationsCommunications and the dissemination of information is so ubiquitous now that we hardly even realize the constant flow of information hitting us. Prior to WWII, the main form of household communications device most people had in their homes was the radio. Televisions existed, but they were generally very expensive and the programming options were very few. The television exploded in popularity in the 1950s, allowing people to watch important events as they happened in real time.For example, many Americans watched Neil Armstrong's landing on the moon in 1969 from the comfort of their own couch. Likewise, the televised 1953 coronation of Queen Elizabeth II allowed many British residents to see the pomp and circumstance surrounding a royal coronation for the first time.As the decades wore on, television technology became better and better as color televisions largely replaced the original black-and-white sets in the 1970s. Accessories such as video cassette recorders (VCRs) proliferated as screens got larger and the definitions became crisper. In the 1990s, high definition (HD) televisions hit the market which produced a markedly more crisp and vibrant picture than before, though it took approximately a decade before HD televisions became household items in the United States.Telephones also experienced a similarly accelerated increase in use and technological development after WWII. From its invention by Alexander Graham Bell in the late 19th century, the telephone grew increasingly popular and largely replaced the telegraph by WWII, with approximately 30 million phones in service by 1948. After WWII, telephone use continued to expand quickly and by the 1970s over 100 million phones were in use.The next major advancement in telephone communication came in the 1990s with the proliferation of the cellular phone. Though portable and in-vehicle phones had been experimented with since the 1940s, the first true cellular phones (that is, one that pedestrians could carry with them) did not arrive until the 1980s, and even then they were relatively large, clunky objects and were too expensive for the average person. This changed in the 1990s as cell phones got smaller, faster, and cheaper.The proliferation of text messaging in the early 2000s turned the cellular phone into a multi-use tool. The creation of the smartphone, and most notably Apple's iPhone, which essentially turned the cell phone into a computer as well, has completely changed the cell phone, putting access to a world of information on a device which only a couple decades ago was used merely for making telephone calls.TransportationThe world of transportation has seen similar improvements in technology since WWII, though not nearly the same level of innovation. Indeed, our main modes of transportation - automobile, airplane, train, or ship - are still the same, though they have all undergone serious transformations to improve safety and efficiency.The world of automobiles, for example, remained largely unchanged for the first century of its existence, but in the past quarter century, environmental awareness and the high price of oil and gasoline has spurred research and development in cars fueled by alternative sources of fuel. All major auto companies now either have an electric car being developed or on the road, and all have successful gas/electric hybrid models, such as the Toyota Prius or the Ford Fusion Hybrid.Air travel has made more significant advances since WWII with the advent of the jet engine in the 1950s. Prior to the jet engine, all planes were prop-engines, which used large propellers to generate the speed and air flow over the wings necessary for flight. The jet engine provided enormous amounts of thrust, which made the propeller obsolete, though it should be noted many prop planes are still in service today.With the jet engine, planes could now fly farther and faster and carry larger loads. Since WWII commercial air travel has exploded in popularity and safety on airlines has gotten increasingly better - as of this writing in early 2014, the United States' domestic airlines (think Delta, United, or American Airlines) have gone over four years without a major crash.",science

NH-VSWGksQc,Exploring Japan's cutting edge science and technology!,"Science Square Tsukuba: http://www.aist.go.jp/sst/en/IbakiraTV: https://www.youtube.com/ibarakiThe local government in Ibaraki gave us free reign for three days to film whatever places we wanted, and our second stop was Science Square Tsukuba, a showcase of the cutting edge technologies being researched at AIST (The National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology). There were A LOT of displays! We mainly filmed the areas that were somewhat interactive to make for a more engaging video, but there was a lot of really interesting information on what technologies are being developed right now! There's information in English on touchscreens next to all the displays and it is not dumbed down for anyone! I super recommend this center if you love science and technology.This is part of Tsukuba Science City, which is a planned city in Japan that aggregates scientific academies, research institutions, museums, and even JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency--Japan's version of NASA). It's right next to the geology museum, and a few blocks away is Tsukuba Expo Center, the site of the 1985 Science Exposition. It now hosts Japan's largest observatory and planetarium. And right near that is the Tsukuba Space Center, one of Tsukuba's most popular attractions. If you're into science and technology at all, Tsukuba Science City is a must!!★ Patreon! http://patreon.com/rachelandjun★T-shirts & Merch! http://rachelandjun.spreadshirt.com/►FOLLOW US　ε=┌(　･д･)┘Our Japan channel  ⇀  https://www.youtube.com/RachelandJunJun's Kitchen ⇀ https://www.youtube.com/JunsKitchenTwitch ⇀ https://www.twitch.tv/rachelandjunGaming ⇀ https://www.youtube.com/RachelandJunGameTwitter | Instagram  *@RachelandJun*►EQUIPMENT (Amazon affiliates links) ＿〆(・∀ ・ )Camera ⇀ GH5 (http://amzn.to/2GJWsN2)Vlog camera ⇀ RX100 V (http://amzn.to/2DYBZSI)Editing program ⇀ Vegas Pro 15 (http://bit.ly/RnJVEGAS)►MUSIC ♪♪(o*゜∇゜)o～♪♪Music from Epidemic Sound: https://goo.gl/wiYvVqLife has no limits!

It began in the 1960s being housed in the Munitions Building (no longer a standing building) on Constitution Avenue in Washington, DC. FSTC produced scientific and technical intelligence concerning ground forces weapons, equipment, and technology of foreign armies. Most of the effort was on enemies and potential enemies of the United States. FSTC provided scientific and technical intelligence in support of military commanders, materiel developers, and of Department of the Army, Department of Defense, and National-level decisionmakers.FSTC was established on 1 August 1962. It was created using personnel and resources belonging to Army Technical Services intelligence agencies:-    The Chemical Corps Intelligence Agency-    The Ordnance Technical Intelligence Agency-    The Quartermaster Intelligence Agency-    The Signal Intelligence Agency-    The Transportation Intelligence Agencyas well as intelligence resources from the Army Corps of Engineers and the Technical Intelligence Field Agency. (Sec. X., Department of the Army General Order 46, 25 July 1962)At the same time, some of the intelligence resources from the former Army Technical Services intelligence agencies were used to create the US Army Area Analysis Intelligence Agency (AAIA). A short time later the AAIA was absorbed by the new Defense Intelligence Agency...The predecessor agencies had grown out of the intelligence staffs created in the offices of the Chiefs of the Army Technical Services shortly before World War II. FSTC was created to consolidate Army technical intelligence activities when McNamara reorganizations in the early 1960s restructured Army procurement and supply activities and eliminated several of the Army Technical Services. (Department of the Army General Order 47, DA, 26 July 1962) FSTC was made subordinate to the US Army Materiel Command which was created as the main procurement agency of the Army in place of the Army Technical Services...The new Center found a home in the Munitions Building on the Mall in Washington, DC. When President Nixon ordered that the Munitions Building be demolished in 1970, FSTC relocated to a federal office complex in downtown Charlottesville, Virginia...On 1 July 1984, command of FSTC was transferred to the US Army Intelligence Agency, a field operating agency operating under the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Army General Staff...On 12 October 1991 the US Army Intelligence Agency was reassigned to the US Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM)...On 10 April 1992, FSTC was reassigned from AAIA to INSCOM...On 8 July 1994, FSTC and the US Army Intelligence and Threat Analysis Center were merged. The new organization, named the National Ground Intelligence Center, with its headquarters in Charlottesville, VA, was created as a ""provisional"" organization... On 1 October 1995, the National Ground Intelligence Center was confirmed as an official, permanent Army organization...Data concerning the size of FSTC throughout its existence is not available. However, some information is available. A count of the entries in the October 1963 telephone directory showed 348 persons working at FSTC and its ""field activities."" In January 1967, the total workforce included 401 persons (63 officers, 2 warrant officers, 3 enlisted men, and 333 civilian workers). (Table of Distribution and Allowance M1-WOKPAA-00, 15 January 1967) By October 1984, the workforce had grown to 529 (35 officers, 8 enlisted men, and 486 civilians)...",science

RxmzCJug9HE,Science and Technology for Supporting Decisions in Natural Disasters | Bijan Khazai | TEDxKIT,"Disasters such as earthquakes, typhoons and floods have devastating impacts on a community’s ability to thrive. Actionable decisions to prepare for, respond to and recover from natural disasters require a personalized understanding of risk. Most existing catastrophe risk assessment models consume huge amounts of time and data and are costly to use. They are commonly applied for assessment of high-value facilities, but numerous small and medium enterprises throughout disaster prone regions typically do not have the capacity and financial means to employ these modeling tools and services. Opening up risk models to a wider community and communicating risk outputs in a way that is useful to ordinary citizens and businesses can play a pivotal role in being better prepared for natural disasters.Dr. Bijan Khazai is a research scientist at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology’s (KIT) Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM). He holds Masters and Doctoral degrees in Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering from the University of California at Berkeley, where he worked on developing GIS-based landslide hazard assessment models in the San Francisco Bay Area. Dr. Khazai’s research interests are social vulnerability analysis, megacity and urban risk, and information technology for post-disaster recovery planning. As a project specialist for Earthquake and Megacities Initiative (EMI), he has worked in a number of applied projects in Istanbul, Amman and Metro Manila and Mumbai.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

4u3f7_p1i8c,Dr.John Hagelin: Veda and Physics: The Science and Technology of the Unified Field,"John Hagelin (Ph.D. Quantum Physics) addresses the International Conference to Re-Establish Vedic India, 20 February, 2015 on Veda and Physics: The Science and Technology of the Unified Field.Summary points: Vedic Science in Our Modern WorldVedic Science is scientific, practical, and indispensable in this modern age. The Vedic tradition is founded upon the complete knowledge and practical application of the ultimate reality—the unified field.Modern physics has systematically explored finer levels of creation, smaller and smaller time and distance scales, from the classical macroscopic world to the atomic and nuclear levels, culminating in the discovery of one underlying unified field of existence at the basis of all diversity in the universe.Ancient Vedic science has likewise explored finer and finer levels of mind and matter, culminating in the discovery and direct experience of one unified field of life—the field of transcendental existence, or pure consciousness. This unbounded field of pure knowledge is known as Veda.Are the unified field and Veda one and the same reality? Both sciences, one ancient and subjective and the other modern and objective, describe manifest creation as an expression of infinite dynamism embedded in the infinite silence of the underlying field. Physics describes this relationship in terms of the unified field and vacuum energy, and Vedic Science in terms of Shiva and Shakti.Similarly, at every level of manifest creation, these two descriptions of nature’s functioning correspond exactly. Physics describes three superfields giving rise to the five spin types that characterize elementary particles, the resonant frequencies of the unified field and building blocks of creation; Vedic Science speaks of the three Prakritis or Doshas giving rise to the five Mahabhutas that structure the universe.Moreover, this correspondence extends to the unmanifest level as well—the self-interacting dynamics of the underlying field. The structure of Rk Veda unfolds sequentially from initial wholeness to 8 to 24 to 64 to 192 elaborations. Similarly, superstring theory in physics describes 8 fundamental vibrational modes of the unified field, which unfold sequentially to 24, 64, and 192 degrees of freedom within the field.This correspondence is intriguing, but how can it be practically applied? The ancient Vedic technologies of consciousness, revived by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, allow anyone to gain direct experiential access to the unified field on the level of consciousness and to apply this holistic experience to all aspects of daily life and living.The process of transcending—moving from articulated thought (Vaikari) to abstract conceptual thought (Madhyama) to fine feeling (Pashyanti) to pure consciousness, the Self (Atma)—provides the experience of levels of mind at each level corresponding to mathematical structures that have evolved sequentially to describe these more abstract levels of existence.Yoga, at its deepest level, is the experience of transcendence (Samadhi)—the union of individual awareness with cosmic intelligence through the effortless transcending process embodied in the TM technique.This experience of transcendence is a fourth major state of consciousness, a “wakeful hypo-metabolic state” of profound EEG coherence and deep physiological rest, which has been shown through extensive scientific research to produce wide-ranging, measurable benefits for mental and physical health, as well as significant cost savings for health care.Modern pharmacological approaches to health care operate on the chemical level, but Vedic approaches to health care (Ayurveda, Yoga) operate at the level of the unified field. These are Atma-based, unified field-based approaches, with correspondingly greater efficacy and power.Similarly, Vedic approaches to education, defense, and civilization as a whole are Atma-based, unified field-based approaches, completely holistic and free from negative side effects. Thus the Vedic tradition is founded upon the complete knowledge and practical application of ultimate reality—the unified field.",science

PPVY1BPYY2o,Postdoc's dorm room at POSTECH (Pohang University of Science and Technology),"This video shows the accommodation (provided at the rate of KRW 200,000 per month) to postdoctoral researchers whose marital status is single. This episode shows most of the amenities and furnishings in the private room. Be sure to watch the other video too, which shows surroundings outside of the private room. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=...)I made this video to show what it looks like because I was never told anything about the accommodation, other than that the university had signed me up for it without my explicit permission. I had no idea about its location, or what it looked like, or anything. This video attempts to give you an idea of what the provided accommodation looks like, including amenities and room furnishing. It should help you in your packing. Since I was told nothing, I did not know what to bring. I will explain the pro's and con's. (In fact, other than being told that the university had automatically signed up for housing, I was not given ANY detail about the accommodation until 2 days before my postdoc contract started. In fact, three days before my contract started, I had received an e-mail stating ""your accommodation hasn't been decided yet.  Tomorrow, the housing office wil let me know. So then i will give you the address."")There was a deposit amount of KRW 300,000.The video shows the content of the room. On the door is an electronic lock system. You can set a personal code to use to unlock the door. It is convenient because you never have to carry a key (other than the key card to get in and out of the building's main entrance). It is big enough to fit the provided furniture (bed, desk, orange chair, refrigerator, wash basin, large closet, small closet). It is not big enough to fit in anything else.At least the room is furnished, but you will have to provide your own bed sheets and pillow.There is not even enough room on the ground to fit in a spare mattress for an overnight visitor (and I suppose this partially explains why the building's policy is to have no overnight guests).What is not clear from this video is that this building (Male dormitory building 19) is in close proximity to other dorm buildings, including freshmen dorms. On any night of the week, at ANY hour, it is likely that very loud, rude, and drunk college students will walk between the buildings and wake you up.Overall, the provided accommodation is extremely bad and shameful for a first-rate university to provide as housing for its postdocs. Should you come here, at least you can use these videos to see what you will get. (The contract which you must sign, which you don't get to see before coming, stipulates that you'll live in the provided accommodation for at least 6 months.)What's also very interesting is that the four nearby high-rise GRADUATE STUDENT APARTMENTS are much nicer than these, with private kitchens, bathrooms, and several bedrooms. I hope the university wisens up and treats us postdocs the way we deserve to be treated.",science

The university often ranks highly among other universities of a similar age.KAIST was established in February 1971 as Korea Advanced Institute of Science, with a loan given by United States Agency for International Development. The university aimed not only to educate young researchers in science and engineering, but also to provide a solid basis for the development of future higher education institutions in Korea.Its structure was created by an international team, which included the American electrical engineer and vice-president of Stanford University Frederick Emmons Terman. Unlike other public institutions in South Korea, KAIST has freedom to decide upon its entry requirements and course structure, which gives the university a special status.Today, KAIST has a rich academic portfolio in disciplines such as physics, mathematics, engineering, humanities and social sciences, business and management. The courses are delivered by 6 colleges and 2 schools, with over 33 divisions. KAIST’s unique institutes include the National NanoFab Center, which conducts research into nano-devices and their potential applications.KAIST consists of 2 major campuses situated in Daejeon and South Korea’s capital Seoul. They offer over 25 dormitories, 4 libraries and a medical centre. To ensure students are actively engaged in the campus cultural events, the university organises traditional opera and jazz recitals.Some of the most famous KAIST former faculty members and graduates are the electrical engineer Soon-dal Choi, mathematician Gi-hyong Gho and the physicist Chang Hee Nam.Subsribe on Happy Traveler - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB7V...",science

Learn more at http://www.techinnovationdegree.uw.edu.Video Transcript:[Shwetak] What the MSTI, or the master’s of science and technology innovation degree, is all about is to really provide a broad understanding of what it means to innovate on a piece of technology. This includes the design aspect of it. How do you know that you're building the right thing and how you're building it right? But also prototyping. How do you know that the thing that you're trying to build is even feasible? So appreciating hardware and software development so that you know that this thing can even be built. And then pitching it, and then getting funding for it. So the entrepreneurial side of how do you launch a venture like this. And so the program is designed to integrate across all three of these different areas in an offering where a student can do it in one specific degree.[Linda] I think increasingly, in the pace of innovation and development in the technology fields, there's a growing expectation that any one person has a more rounded skillset, that has some of each of those in their skillset. And those are the professionals and the emerging students that are in more demand.The program is a 15-month program, so you would start in the fall, go the full four quarters and then a fifth quarter which is your launch phase.[Shwetak] So the first 12 months is you'll be iterating on a number of different projects, and you learn the, just the basics through these classes and tutorials.[Linda] Each quarter there's going to be a range of classes from some sort of very specific hands-on studios, something maybe as specific as a hardware-software lab or something about micro-controllers, to a design-thinking studio, which is going to be more processed based.[Shwetak] In the last three months of the 15-month period is what we call the launch phase. So you really settle on a particular project that you want to take it to the next level.It could be that you're working on a project that's sponsored by a corporation. It can be something where the student comes in and has their own idea, recruits students within the cohort to help them with their project that might get them to a point where they start to maybe spin out a company at the end of the program.[Linda] UW has a fantastic reputation for being the most innovative public university, which is wonderful. There's such a great embracing and support structure here at the University, and in Seattle more broadly, for innovation, for startups.[Shwetak] One of the things that's interesting about this program is not just the top faculty engaging with the students, but it's also the mentors and the, and the technologists and the thought leaders in the Pacific Northwest. This includes members of the venture capital community. It includes engineers and thought leaders at companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Boeing.[Linda] So there's a really, a coalescing of that energy, those services, that perspective, that experience in the community here from industry, that GIX will be able to tap into.[Shwetak] So the MSTI is housed within the Global Innovation Exchange.[Linda] GIX, Global Innovation Exchange, is a unique partnership between University of Washington, Tsinghua University and industry partners, most notably Microsoft. It encompasses a new type of interdisciplinary degree program that is much more team- and project-based, hands-on, to develop a closer partnership between industry partners and the educational experience and to really bring together kind of three different domains: technical innovation, an entrepreneurship lens and understanding of the business landscape.[Shwetak] And so we're looking at how do we engage the larger community? Not just the local community, but the global community, to create these really innovative graduate programs that allow students to solve these real-world problems and do it in such a way that's global in spirit.[Linda] So I'm really excited also about the facility that is being developed that will have maker space, and team spaces, studio facilities, you know, be state-of-the-art in terms of technology. It's really going to be a fantastic place for industry, faculty and students to come and work and engage and collaborate.[Shwetak] This program is really designed to teach people how to become innovators.",science

UUvzq6OQWdk,CHINA: BEIJING: NEW SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY MUSEUM,"Keyword-science-technologyMandarin/NatA new science and technology museum in Beijing is luring crowds of Chinese of all ages eager to peer into the future and get hands-on experience with devices which may well transform their lives at some future date.The exhibition is in keeping with the belief of China's leaders that adopting the latest technology and improved quality of life go hand in hand.It is hoped the museum will be a catalyst for China's own scientific developments.It was not even the official big opening for Beijing's new Science and Technology Museum but the size of the crowds said it all.It is clear that the Chinese are enthusiastic about technology and impatient to embrace all the exciting innovations that science can bring.Futuristic forms of transport like this magnetic levitating train may one day be the main mode of transport between Beijing and Shanghai.The museum is very user friendly - people can touch and operate most of the machines, and special transparent casings show everyone how things work.Displays are designed to stimulate the imagination - this exhibit offers the experience of a walk on the moon.SOUNDBITE: (Mandarin)""I was out of control. I bounced up and down and had lots of fun.""SUPER CAPTION:  Liu Rui Yi, 'moon walker'And for those who prefer to fly closer to Earth, there's a flight simulator where would-be pilots can test their skills.A sportsman would have a hard job beating this fellow at basketball - the mechanical marvel with golden arms never misses a shot.Soccer enthusiasts were shown how to play the game virtually via computer programmes which provide an instant match - without even leaving the house or having to get a team together.And for those who fancy a tightrope ride across the Grand Canyon but without the risk - this is the ride for you.The museum covers over 22-thousand square metres of floor space and contains 340 displays of past, present and future science and technology.The Cold War may be over but children visiting the museum are reminded that the United States holds the military high ground with tactical bombers like the B-1 which can evade attack through the use of stealth technology.Even so, simulated dog fights can still be won by the most determined fighter pilots.SOUNDBITE: (Mandarin)""I will launch a missile to strike it.""SUPER CAPTION: Di NuoExperts are on hand in the museum to explain some of the more significant scientific discoveries, such as electricity, which can be tamed and transformed in a comic example of man's ability to harness the forces of nature.Some of the larger displays are enclosed for the sake of safety.From a distance, audiences can watch the generation and delivery of power, recreated in a scale model.Robotics can be used not only to relieve man of the burden of heavy labour but also to entertain.This mechanical conductor directs a mechanical band in a popular tune.The architecture of the museum itself reflects a scientific theme in the use of the double-helix structure of D-N-A.The Science and Technology Museum will officially open to the general public on 29 April and the entrance fee will be the equivalent of about one dollar.You can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/you...

First up, we’re going to the Dhaka University area to try a famous street food in Dhaka, the Kola Bhorta, an ULTRA complex and delicious street food made in a mortar and pestle. It had hog plum, mustard, olive, tamarind, sugar, chili, coriander, and chili, and was made by the most friendly vendor! It was spicy, sour, bitter, sweet, pungent, and very intense!Next, we’re bringing you to the New Market area of Dhaka, right outside Old Dhaka, an area bustling with food stalls and super fast paced bustle. The street food vendors here work with ULTRA FAST speed and you can tell that everyone is in a hurry because there is so much food and street stalls packed in here.

It was an amazing street food to try! Next up, we’re bringing you to a FAMOUS Restaurant in Dhaka, the MAMA Haleem!

It was an incredibly filling and flavour packed breakfast!And before visiting the BRAIN FRY KING of Bangladesh, we’re going for a FAMOUS biryani dish in Old Dhaka, the Kachi biryani. It was prepared in these huge pots with big goat leg pieces and was one of the most aromatic biryani’s I’ve ever tried! It had a caraway flavour and was a little mustardy as well! Mustard is such an important part of Bengali cuisine, and we fell in love with the food during our trip mainly because of this mustard flavour in everything, it’s so delicious and fluffy!!After the AMAZING Biryani, we’re bringing you to our final stop, the BRAIN FRY KING of Bangladesh!

3uOKebaeSi0,Allahabad Food Tour - Makhan ke ANDE - SAKODA (Spicy Pakoda) - Gulab Jamun (Allahabadi RASGULLA),"The sheer amount of food to try in Allahabad is insane. Trust us, if you start exploring the streets for food you will not be disappointed. First Stop- Indian Coffee HouseWe started our day with the basics- coffee and keema omelette. Wait! Ok not so basic. The keema omelette serves as the perfect start to your day. It is not too spicy and not heavy either, but it will keep you stomach happy and satisfied.Second Stop- Sheebu Omelette ShopIf you’re looking for that perfect breakfast and chai combination, this is the place to be. This 35 year old shop is known for serving some of the most buttery Bun- Omelette in the area. The omelette is very simple, it consists of onions, green chillies and coriander and cooked in a whole lot of butter. You can either go for the bun-omelette or a simple bun-butter, and boy do they use butter liberally! Enjoy all of this with a side of steaming hot chai.Third Stop- VIP RasgullaFor all those people who are going to get confused when they see Gulab Jamuns instead of Rasgullas, hold your horses people! In Allahabad, the humble gulab jamuns are known as rasgulla. VIP Rasgulla is known for some of the tastiest gulab jamun. These gulab jamuns have dried fruits and cardamom in the filling as well. Truly delicious!Fourth Stop- Dehati Rasgulla ShopAnother famous rasgulla/gulab jamun shop. These gulab jamuns are slightly darker in colour since the khoya is cooked for a longer time is caramelized. These gulab jamuns are fried twice to get the deep dark colour that gives it a unique taste.Fifth Stop- Sophiya Lawrence Betel ShopThe paan here is unlike any we have had. The stickiness that the normal meetha paan has because of the gulkand cannot be tasted in this paan. It is as smooth as butter. Sixth Stop- Pandit Ji ki ChaatWhen it comes to chaat we really let loose. We tried a number of different dishes here. The gol gappas served here are not your run of the mill ones. They serve you gol gappa/pulki with a variety of fillings- with chickpeas and tamarind chutney, super hot and spicy sakoda curry or with dahi and tamarind chutney. They also give the Allahabadi classic Sakoda in a kulhad. Sakoda is a fritter made with pulses and spinach and served in a curry that is super hot. The Hara Aloo or basically aloo chaat is quite unique, with flavors of coriander and green chillies. Then to cool oneself down, go for the dahi badas.Seventh Stop- Nirala Mishtan BhandarHere we tried the aloo ki tikiya that is nicely fried in desi ghee. It is topped with tamarind chutney, yoghurt, aloo lachha. This dish is super crispy and super tasty. Here also get the Kaali Gajar ke Halwa and some of the best laddus we have tried in a long time.Eighth Stop- Hari Ram & SonsThis shop has been since 1890 serving dried samosas to worldwide and a lot more. The samosa is stuffed with potatoes and fried in desi ghee. These samosas are supposed to have a shelf life of a month.Ninth Stop- Raja Ram LassiRight across Hari Ram & Sons is this lassi shop. Their lassi comes in the good old kulhad. It is thick and creamy and is flavoured with some saffron, and topped off with a layer of cream and rabri.Tenth Stop- Shri Radhey Ras Kunj Sweet HouseAnother unique discovery was Makhan ke Andey at this place. The butter is shaped like an egg and has a filling of khoya mixed with saffron which ends up looking like a yolk.Eleventh Stop- Ahmad Kabab CentreThis place is a Kabab lover’s delight! We tried the roasted chicken, haryali chicken, roasted chicken wings, and nizami chicken tikka. Everything is beautifully marinated here that the spices have literally seeped into every part of the chicken pieces.Twelfth Stop- Bukhara Mughlai KhanaOur final stop was all about home cooked food. This place is known for meals that are cooked at home and sold to people to spread the joy. Here we had some shammi kababs, boti kabab and mutton in khara masala along with some ulte tawe ka paratha and roomali roti. Each and every dish was not too spicy  or oily and it tastes just like home.#AllahabadFoodTour #WalkwithDelhiFoodWalksAbout the host - Anubhav Sapra :Anubhav Sapra is an avid foodie!

TALATA VOLON’ONDRY: Sausage + KobaADDRESS: Talata Volon’ondry OPEN: Varies Talata Volon’ondry is a village located just outside of Antananarivo. The village is known for producing sausage and Madagascar’s national snack, koba. 🥔SAUSAGE: There are typically two types of sausage being sold - zebu sausage and a halal style potato sausage. This snack is frequently accompanied by local rum. 🇲🇬KOBA: Lay out banana leaf spines with banana leaves on top. Add a layer of rice flour to prevent the koba mixture from sticking to the banana leaves. Then add the koba mixture, a combination of crushed raw peanuts and sugar. Wrap it all up in the banana leaves and allow it to cook in a bit of water for 3 days. Koba is beloved across Madagascar, primarily sold on the street or to people in their cars as they drive through a city.

If you just walk in you can get 400 or 600 gram shrimp probably, but the 800 gram single shrimp are hard to come by these days in Thailand.Kui Mong (กุ่ยหมง) is very well known among Thais, mainly because most restaurant grill their river shrimp, but Kui Mong (กุ่ยหมง) is the first to deep fry them, and serve them in a ridiculously delicious oily shrimp sauce. The sauce is one of the greatest things you’ll ever taste on rice, combined with more chili garlic sauce and an alternating bite of succulent river shrimp.They owners family are very nice, but unfortunately since it’s such a secret recipe, we weren’t able to see the cooking - so that’s why this is just a short extra Thai food video - only showing the massive deep fried Thai river shrimp and eating them.Price - 2,000 THB ($63.44), per 800 grams shrimpKui Mong (กุ่ยหมง)Address: Khok Khram, Bang Pla Ma District, Suphan Buri 72150, Thailand (Google map: https://goo.gl/maps/1hmdXEXFddr)People featured in this video:David (The Hungry Tourist): https://www.instagram.com/the.hungry....Puppup: https://www.instagram.com/puppup_food...Abram: https://www.instagram.com/ramen_beast/Sinan: https://www.instagram.com/tatdedektifi/Thank you for watching this video.

DN5rJ_lKZJw,Street Food in Bangladesh -The ULTIMATE Old Dhaka Street Food Tour - Bengali Street Food HEAVEN!,"Street Food in Bangladesh is AMAZING! We found some of the BEST Bangladeshi Street food in  Old Dhaka! Join us as we take you for the ULTIMATE Bengali street food adventure through the DEEP back alleys of Old Dhaka! Today I'm (Trevor James, The Food Ranger), bringing you for some of the BEST Street Food in Bangladesh!Make sure to follow The Food Ranger behind the scenes here:►https://www.instagram.com/thefoodranger►Make sure to Subscribe to The Food Ranger here: http://bit.ly/2cCy2ubBangladesh is a true street food heaven. We didn't know when we flew in, but there is a LOT of delicious street food to eat in Bangladesh. In Old Dhaka, AKA Puran Dhaka, you can  spend a lifetime trying new street foods around every corner. And what I loved so much from eating street food around Old Dhaka was not only the delicious mustardy flavour of the street food here, but the friendliness of the Bangladeshi people. Everywhere we went to eat street food in Bangladesh, the peoople welcomed us with open hearts and a big smile. It left a huge impression on us and left us inspired to come back to eat more street food in Bangladesh again. The Bengali food you will taste when you travel in Bangladesh is incredibly delicious. After tasting my first bharta in Old Dhaka, I was convinced that this is some of the best street food around the world. There truly is no other flavour like the food in Bangladesh! You have to come here to try it yourself!To start out our HUGE Bangladesh Street Food Tour, we visited Puran dhaka AKA Old dhaka bright and early to eat some famous Dhakan Bhakor Khani, also known as the Dhakan biscuit. It's a wheat dough and semolina flour biscuit that has 2 versions, one sweet and one plain. The sweet version has dough and semolina soaked in molasses and saffron. The dough is pushed DEEP inside the tandoor oven, the same ovens used to cook famous Bangladeshi recipes all over the country. It goes PERFECTLY with some delicious Bangladeshi street chai! There are many Bakorkhani stalls in Puran Daka (Old Dhaka), but we visited the most famous one, Nashu Faruker Shera Bakorkhani.After that amazing Bangladeshi street food biscuit, we went for the ULTIMATE meal of Bangladeshi cuisine, the bhorta feast! We're taking you to Nirob Hotel for some AMAZING Bhortas! When you first come to Bangladesh, everyone tells you to eat the Bhortas, and you may not be sure what they are. Bhortas are a special Bengali cuisine usually made of mashed fish or mashed vegetables with mustard oil, chili, garlic, onion, and the occasional sprinkle of lime. The bhortas are all brought to your table and you pay for what you eat, and leave what you don't touch. I ate a SPICY duck curry that was out of this world! After the amazing Bengali curry heaven, we made our way to the most FAMOUS street food in Old Dhaka, the haji biryani. Highly seasoned rice is cooked in mustard oil and filled with extremely tender goat meat and topped with lime! SUPER TASTY!After this, we're bringing you to a solid street dessert in Old Dhaka, Bangladesh, the lassi and faluda, found at beauty lassi, one of the tastiest lassis in the whole country! I personally loved the faluda and found it to be one of my favourite desserts I've ever had!After the lassi, we're taking you to try a famous Bangladeshi street food, the Pitha rice flour pancake loaded with spicy mustard bhorta. You can find these all over the streets of Old Dhaka and you should definitely try one!After this, we're finishing off the night by going for the famous Murgh pulao found at nanna biryani. The best part of this dish was the sweet and rich onion gravy that covered the super tender chicken and pulao rice!If you're thinking of traveling to Bangladesh to eat street food in Bangladesh, DO IT! The food is amazing, the people are friendly, and you will have a great time! I know we will be back for sure!► BRAND NEW Chili Oil 4 Life Merch here:  https://www.thefoodranger.com/Chilioi...The Food Ranger YouTube: ► www.youtube.com/thefoodrangerThe Food Ranger Instagram:► www.instagram.com/thefoodrangerThe Food Ranger FB:► www.facebook.com/thefoodranger► MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): http://bit.ly/FoodRangerMusic►BEST VPN FOR CHINA (ACCESS YOUTUBE): http://bit.ly/AccessYouTubeinChina► MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: https://shop.bonfire.com/thefoodranger/We're going for more street food around the world!",food

UvDGBIkJaqQ,"Chinese Street Food DAN DAN NOODLE Tour in Sichuan, China | INSANELY GOOD and SPICY Szechuan Noodles","One of the best Chinese street foods you will ever eat in China is the Dan Dan Noodles!  Spicy Chinese Dan Dan noodles are the best street food in China! If you love spicy Sichuan food and street food in China, then you're going to love Dan Dan noodles, because they are so flavorful and covered in a rich chili oil!In this Chinese street food video, we're bringing you on a full on Dan Dan noodle tour of Chengdu, China, DEEP in the heart of Sichuan in Southwest China. This is the land of delicious and spicy Sichuan cuisine, sometimes spelled Szechuan cuisine. There are so many famous Sichuan foods to try here in Chengdu, but today, we are trying 4 different variations of Dan Dan noodles, also sometimes called Zajiang noodles.

In my opinion, the best noodle dish in China is dan dan noodles, right here in Chengdu, Sichuan. China has some of the best street food around the world, and these dan dan noodles were INSANELY GOOD, some of the best noodles in China for sure!If you're traveling to China to eat and try different street foods, and perhaps want to learn a little bit about Chinese food and chinese cooking in the process, you need to try a few different variations of Dan Dan noodles. When they prepare the traditional Chinese dan dan noodle recipe right on the street, you can watch as they scoop the main ingredients like chili oil, soy sauce, sichuan peppercorn, and garlic right into the noodle bowl and then place the steaming hot noodles right over top. It's truly satisfying! After they put the noodles over top, they place their signature fried ground pork on top, known in Chinese as shaozi. When your dan dan noodles arrive to your table, it is very important to mix up all the chili oil and all of the ingredients throughout. This ensures that the flavour and the hot oil gets coated onto each noodle before you take a bite. It's also quite satisfying mixing the noodles and watching the dark red oil slowly turn each noodle from white into red and silky smooth. When you take your first bite, you'll understand why this is one of the BEST Chinese street foods you need to try. The spicy noodles are coated with an incredibly aromatic chili oil and really send you straight up to heaven! It's one of the best forms of Chinese cooking!

ZSm1InvSMBA,Japanese Highway Food Challenge ★ ONLY in JAPAN,"Japanese Highway Service Areas or Rest Stops are quite amazing and in this episode we’ll look at one of them that has a food challenge! Tomobe SA in Ibaraki Prefecture has a restaurant that has taken the highest mountain in the area and turned it into a dish. Mount Tsukuba is 877 meters high, but as food, it looks steeper and more intimidating. 16 long cuts of grilled pork cutlets smothered in a savory sauce on a bed of shredded cabbage and rice weighing more than 1kg (2.2 lbs). It may not be as big as some food challenges like the 2.2kg (5 lbs) Monster Gyoza in failed to eat in 2014, but it is still an interesting dish. It costs 1700 Yen ($15) for the set with miso soup and some pickles. Eaters can simply order it from a vending machine and it takes about 5-7 minutes to prepare. Do you think you can take down Mount Tsukuba in meat?

We're starting the noodle tour in Beijing, China, and enjoying a huge bowl of Beijing Zhajiangmian AKA Beijing Zhajiang noodles, one of the most fragrant and satisfying noodle chews you'll ever experience. AND, we're complimenting that bowl of Beijing noodles with a delicious bowl of pork organ stew, an intense organ aroma stew with chopped intestines and lungs. Delicious!After traveling to Beijing to eat noodles, we're flying direct into Lanzhou, the home of the world famous muslim Chinese street food. Here, the local Hui chinese cook up some of the best Halal Chinese food in the world, and have a UNIQUE specialty that is worth flying for, the Lanzhou lamian, AKA Lanzhou ramen AKA lanzhou beef noodle soup! WOW! This is one of the BEST noodle dishes you'll ever taste! And watching the extremely tasty Lanzhou noodles being hand pulled is one of the most satisfying things to watch too! The beef noodle soup is made with beef fat and bone and also lots of local radish which gives it an incredibly complex and satisfying aroma to slurp on!! And you can order up as many slices of beef to put on top of your lanzhou noodles as well!After traveling to Lanzhou, we're flying in to Chengdu to eat Sichuan food and of course, the one and only Sichuan Dan Dan noodles!!! Dan dan noodles or Dandan mian as they are called here in China are one of the most incredibly aromatic and ""Xiang"" bowls of noodles you'll ever experience. The spicy chili oil and the intense pork aroma with a slight earthy kick from pickled mustard greens is truly unlike anything in the whole world. You have to fly here to eat these! They are absolutely incredible! AND, we're topping off the noodles with a nice plump bowl of Hongyouchaoshou AKA Chinese hot chili oil wontons! They burst in your mouth with flavour and chili oil! WOWWW!!! In Chengdu, Sichuan cuisine is at the top of it's game, super flavourful and intense with Sichuan chili and peppercorn, and I definitely recommend flying in to eat it!After Chengdu dan dan noodles, we're taking a direct flight to Shanghai to eat my personal favourite bowl of noodles in the city, and a bowl that is worth flying in direct to China to eat for, the majiang mian AKA sesame butter noodles. The noodles are full of chili oil and sesame butter mixed together, so you have this EXTREMELY satisfying nutty and spicy combo over top of springy al dente noodles, and, you can top it off with some nice spicy pork chunks! It doesn't get any better than that!! Another BIG WOW!!!After shanghai, we're finishing this food travel video by flying in direct to Hong Kong, another world famous food destination, to eat some cantonese cuisine and some southern Chinese noodles, the ganchaoniuhe, AKA stir fried chinese rice noodles with tender slices of beef! We're visiting a local daipaidong AKA Chinese street food alley stall that is packed with hungry locals who all love eating tons of delicious Cantonese cuisine and seafood! At this daipaidong, aiwensheng, you can eat a lot of different Chinese seafoods and stir fried cantonese cuisine dishes, but we came in solely to eat the stir fried rice noodles, but we couldn't help ourselves and ordered a mud crab and some fried seafood as well because it looked so good!

We started our trip in Lahore, a vibrant, colorful, and packed full of food city. Our first day in Lahore turned out to be a 16 hour street food marathon in Lahore, and it was an amazing day!Get more details on my Pakistan Travel Guide: https://goo.gl/5MHgz4Sadiq Halwa Puri (https://goo.gl/maps/Yoy9dJ6steF2) - We began the day with a very common breakfast throughout Pakistan, halwa puri, but along with chana curry (chickpea curry). We ate off the car, enjoying every bit of the freshly fried puris and curry.Total price - 640 PKR ($4.78)Chacha Feeka Lassi (https://goo.gl/maps/RGQBRQaNj8p) - Next we drove over to Gawalmandi, one of the most legendary areas in Lahore for food. We headed straight to a breakfast staple, the lassi shop and had the most creamy heavy milkshake I’ve ever had, called a pera lassi.Roasted chickpeas - 25 PKR ($0.19) - After exiting an alley, right in front of us was a man selling chickpeas and corn roasted in black Himalayan salt. It’s a very common street food snack in Pakistan.Sweet potato - 80 PKR ($0.60) - Sweet potato is also a very common street food snack in Lahore, seasoned with masala and a type of citrus juice.Baba Kulfi Wala - Next we headed over to Shah Alami Market, another huge and bustling market in Lahore.Kulfi - 20 PKR ($0.15) each - One of the most famous places to eat ice cream in Lahore is Baba Kulfi Wala, and you’ll find a crowd of people standing around the corner of the road eating sticks of their famous kulfi.Orange juice - 50 PKR ($0.37)Chana chaat - 120 PKR ($0.89) per plate - One of my personal favorite Pakistani street food snacks of the day was chana chaat, a chickpea snack. He added in all sorts of spices, chutneys, and seasonings, to create a deliciously refreshing snack.Butt Karahi Tikka Restaurant - Easily one of the most well known restaurants in Lahore is Butt Karahi, specializing in curry made in a rounded pan, called a karahi (we will be eating a lot of karahi’s in Pakistan!). We ordered both a mutton karahi and chicken karahi. Both were amazing, filled with spices and butter, but the tenderness of the mutton was the winner.Total price - 5,600 PKR ($41.84)Siddique Fish Corner - You’ll notice that Lahore seems to come alive at night, and street food is everywhere at night. We began the evening with Siddique Fish Corner, one of the best fried fish stalls in Lahore. It was awesome, and so busy.Total price - 400 PKR ($2.99)Khalifa Balochi Sajji - Another Pakistani dish I wanted to try was chicken sajji, a type of hand rotisserie chicken. The atmosphere and cooking method was incredible.Total price - 390 PKR ($2.91)Khan Baba Restaurant - Finally for our last dinner on this 16 hour day of food in Pakistan, we went to one of Ali’s favorite restaurants in Lahore, Khan Baba. The goat chops were impressive as was the korma curry.Again, massive thank you to Ali, from Pakistan Travel Mart for hosting us in Pakistan, taking us around, and organizing everything.

It's not a normal Dubai Street Food, but that's why it's so good. It is an extremely rare Arab food nowadays! You have to be incredibly lucky to experience this whole camel platter! This is definitely one of the must try foods in Dubai! It is a traditional Emirati food and is one of the best things to do in Dubai. Camel meat is something that may be sensitive to some viewers, so make sure you're comfortable with watching the camel cooking! The chefs who prepared the camel recipe were originally from the South of India in Kerala, but have been living in Dubai for over 20 years.If you're thinking of traveling to Dubai for a food trip, you can't go wrong, there is so much delicious Emirati cuisine and amazing street food to try! I must admit, most of the food is in Dubai restaurants that are clean and quiet, but that is part of the charm of Dubai.First, Peyman and I checked out the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, and then made our way to the one and only Camel Restaurant, address below:Entire Camel Platter in Dubai: Zaman Awal RestaurantAddress: Al Boom Village, Dubai, UAE, United Arab EmiratesIf you're wondering if you should eat street food in Dubai or go for regular restaurants in Dubai, I recommend mixing it up and going for both.

Finally, this was our chance, and we went on a Malaysian food tour of Kelantan, around Kota Bharu.Here’s all the amazing food we ate in this video:Nasi Kerabu Panji - Without a doubt, one of the Malaysian foods you don’t want to miss when you visit Kelantan is nasi kerabu, rice salad, but it’s so much more than that. It’s a breakfast dish and we first started at Nasi Kerabu Panji, a local favorite spot. You get blue rice, topped with salad and side dishes, drizzled in budu fermented fish sauce, and topped with you choice of main mean. It was extraordinary.Price - About 8 MYR ($1.96) per plateJijah's Nasi Kerabu - Since nasi kerabu is one of the top Malaysian foods of the state of Kelantan, we decided to have two nasi kerabu’s back to back, but totally different styles and even different colors of rice. Jijah's Nasi Kerabu specializes in grilled goat, and it was incredible, highly recommended when you visit Kelantan, Malaysia.Price - 4.50 MYR ($1.10) per plateSiti Khadijah Market - One of the top attractions in Kota Bharu is Siti Khadijah Market, a beautiful colorful market where you can buy all the ingredients from Kelantan and there’s also an amazing cooked food section.

Akok - 1 MYR ($0.24) for 2 - Later we also tried akok, a popular and local Kelantanese dessert.D'Umi Nasi Ulam - Another Malaysian food you don’t want to miss eating in Kelantan is nasi ulam, rice with raw vegetables, and a mix of dishes, all eaten specifically with budu - fermented anchovy sauce. This restaurant was amazing, a huge mix of dishes, friendly owner, and delicious food. Of course, we couldn’t resist the tempoyak - fermented durian paste.Kak Jah Ayam Percik Bulatan Lemal - Finally to end this Malaysian street food tour of Kelantan, we had some ayam percik, a coconut milk barbecue sauce dish that originates in Kelantan. We barely arrived in time, but luckily got the last few skewers.Ayam percik - 16 MYR ($3.93) per big skewerKelantan is an amazing state in Malaysia to eat Malaysian street food and I thoroughly enjoyed my visit, the incredible food, and friendly people.Thank you for watching this Malaysian food video in Kelantan.

I was happy to be in Karachi to discover the amazing street food, and it didn’t let us down!Here are the things we ate on this ultimate Pakistani street food tour of Karachi, Pakistan:Javed Nihari - I’ve probably said this a few times, but there’s no meatier breakfast (maybe in the world) than nihari, a meat stew that’s often paired with plenty of desi ghee and either brains of bone-marrow. It’s truly a breakfast of meat loving champions, but it is filling and heavy, and so good. Javed Nihari is one of the best places in Karachi to eat nihari.Total price - 1,150 PKR ($8.42)Burns Road - We continued on to Burns Road, one of the legendary street food streets in Karachi. It was a Sunday morning and there were elections happening, so Burns road wasn’t actually that busy. But we did find a few delicious things to try.Arabian paratha - The Arabian paratha, or mataba, or any other names it has across Asia is a stuffed roti. In this case he filled it with chicken and spices and egg before wrapping it up and shallow frying it. It was delicious.Price - 120 PKR ($0.88)Matka kulfi - Also on Burns Road is a maka kulfi shop where they sell Pakistani ice cream in little clay cups. The pistachio and saffron were the best.Price - 50 PKR ($0.37) eachRabri - I’m not huge on sweets, but on Burns Road we need to try rabri.Price - 200 PKR ($0.88)Chicken biryani - Just randomly walking around we decided to try our first plate of Karachi biryani - and Karachi is known for their biryani. It was simple, but very good, with a wonderful flavor of dried lime, and it was just a very cool spot.Price - 80 PRK ($0.59)Liaquatabad - We continued this Pakistani street food tour of Karachi in Liaquatabad a busy market area, full of street food.Qadri Nalli Biryani - This was the highlight of the food tour, if not one of the best dishes of my entire trip to Pakistan. Nalli biryani, Pakistani bone marrow biryani is one of the best things ever.Price - They wouldn’t charge usSalad - His ninja chopping skills brought me in and there was no way I couldn’t stop to eat his salad. Amazing!Price - 40 PKR ($0.28)MashAllah Fish Katakat - The next meal we had was MashAllah Fish Katakat, and a dish called katakat. Most of the time its prepared with organs, but this was with fish, and it was again one of the best dishes I ate in Pakistan. An amazing combination of fish, spices, and chutney.Landhi Dairy Colony - Next we headed to the biggest buffalo colony in Asia, maybe the world. Over 700,000 - 800,000 cattle and livestock live within this area that is within Karachi, Pakistan. It was fascinating to visit and drink the freshest buffalo milk possible.Dua Restaurant - Finally for dinner we finished this Karachi street food tour at Dua Restaurant, a huge restaurant serving grilled meat and karahis. The prawns karahi was the highlight for me.Total price - 4,840 PKR ($35.45)It was an amazing day of street food in Karachi, Pakistan!Watch the entire Pakistani video series: https://youtu.be/Xdya8eym9nMAli: https://goo.gl/VY6NjHJoel: https://goo.gl/5AkWm6MUSIC: https://us.audionetwork.com/Logo: https://goo.gl/VhaLp5CAMERA GEAR I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzFOLLOW:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyThank you for watching!",food

Z-tCeaeLm3E,"Most INSANE LAMB PIT BARBACOA - Mexican Food in Texcoco + AZTEC Pyramids, Mexico!","►SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe►T-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/From Oaxaca, we flew to Mexico City, and to begin our Mexico City food tour!We landed at Benito Juárez International Airport and I had arranged for a driver to meet us at the airport to take us first to eat barbacoa - one of the ultimate of all Mexican meat dishes, and then on to go to the Aztec Pyramids of Teotihuacan.We drove straight to a small town in the mountains called Texcoco. The hills around Texcoco are known for their barbacoa, Mexican style of barbecue. Even when I was in the US, I remember seeing little hole in the wall restaurant serving “Barbacoa estilo Texcoco,” Texcoco style Mexican barbacoa - so it’s famous for this dish.El Pica I - The restaurant I wanted to try was El Pica I, and even in this small mountain town, the restaurant was absolutely bumping - there was a meat party happening. You could smell the aroma of the lamb as we drove in. You choose a table, and you walk around and self serve your food. There are many Mexican foods to eat, but the real reason you come here is for the lamb barbacoa - the most insane lamb pit bbq! The meat is cooked in underground clay ovens, and when they open an oven it looks like they are opening a mine.The lamb barbacoa was some of the most tender meat I’ve ever experienced. It was fatty and juicy and ultra flavorful.Price - 800 MXN ($42.95) for 2 kg.Teotihuacan - Stuffed full of lamb, we continued on to Teotihuacan, the ancient Aztec city, known for its giant pyramids. Unfortunately since we went on a Sunday, it was absolutely packed, so busy that we couldn’t even hike to the top of the Pyramid of the Sun because we ran out of time. But nevertheless, it was still worth visiting and it’s very impressive to see.Entrance price - 70 MXN ($3.76)Highlight of today for me was the insanely irresistible lamb barbacoa in Texcoco, WOW.

thiOicCQRWY,Why we fear the food we eat | Jack Bobo | TEDxTysons,"Pesticides, chemicals, cancer - the world is a scary place and our dinner plate even more so. Or so it seems. Despite what we hear in the media and find in our Facebook feed, food in the United States has never been safer. Why is it then that American consumers have never been more worried about the safety of the foods they eat? Jack Bobo, Vice President for Global Policy at Intrexon Corporation, travels the world discussing the future of food and how to sustainably and nutritiously feed the world in 2050. Before joining Intrexon, Jack spent 13 years at the U.S. Department of State as a senior advisor for global food policy. He was named by Scientific American as one of the 100 most influential people in biotechnology for his work on food trends and the psychology of consumer behavior. In his talk, Jack reveals a startling truth about why we fear the food we eat and how the choices we make affect our personal health and the health of the planet. By recognizing the ways our mind misleads us, we can improve our choices, which might just help us save the planet.  This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",food

In my previous street food tour videos of Chengdu, China, we’ve brought you to hundreds of delicious street food locations. We’ve shot hundreds of Chinese street food tour videos. You’ve watched us eat CRAZY Chinese street food like GIANT LOBSTERS and HUGE KING CRABS, massive bowls of dan dan noodles and more, but today, we’re upgrading and going ALL OUT for a $300 per person splurge at Chengdu’s best restaurant; Yuzhilan, owned by the best Sichuan chef in China, mr Lan.Chef Lan has been working his craft and cooking the best Szechuan cuisine in China for over 35 years, and today, he’s bringing us in to his home kitchen to see how he makes some very special dishes. He is sharing with us his philosophy of cooking and his deep love for Sichuan cuisine, sharing his personal story of learning how to cook Sichuan food and how he has traveled the world to study how to cook. After living in Japan for 2 years and studying in London, he has spend his life perfecting the art of Sichuan cuisine, using only the best local ingredients to bring out the natural flavour in everything he prepares.As soon as we walked into his kitchen, Chef Lan showed us how he prepared his abalone. He explained to us the significance of Abalone in Hong Kong and Guangdong cuisine and how he has used 4 different styles of cooking abalone to bring into his own Sichuan style. It was amazing to watch the stock bubbling and the soft abalone simmering away.After this, Chef lan showed us the AMAZING Kung Lao LOBSTER! A dish he is proud of and worked hard to master, the kung pao lobster was amazing to witness. It was spicy and sweet and served cold with a bowl of guaiweimian AKA cold “strange flavour” noodles.As the lobster was being plated, Chef Lan brought us into his main noodle preparation area, where he uses a MASSIVE blade to hand cut the THINNEST noodles in the WORLD! This was so incredible to watch! Just like watching a taiqi master practice his moves, watching Chef Lan cut the noodles was an unforgettable experience! After he cut the noodles, Chef Lan showed us how each noodle could fit through the thread of a needle!And then it was time to eat this AMAZING Sichuan food! Luxury Sichuan food at it’s finest! There were over 20+ items on the menu, all cooked in Sichuan style yet upgraded flavour wise because all the ingredients were so premium!Chef Lan’s personal philosophy in cooking Sichuan food is to use the best ingredients and to allow them to do the talking and use the sauces only to lightly touch and improve the flavour. We could see that is true on his huge Sichuan food menu:Some of the crazy LUXURY Sichuan foods we ate were: Hot Pot Chicken, chinese Matsutake mushrooms with chinese yam and soup, SUPERIOR Abalone, Hot and Sour DEEP Sea cucumber, Chinese bird’s nest soup, Yuxiang Style Eggplant and Yuxiang style eel, Sichuan dry style rabbit with Sichuan pepper and fermented soya bean, KUNG PAO Lobster, Sichuan Caviar, and more!!

Chinese cooking is some of the best in the world, and in Chengdu, China, the cuisine is world famously known as Sichuan cuisine or Szechuan cuisine. It is spicy and numbing and covered in delicious Chili oil. I moved here to Chengdu specifically to be able to eat spicy and delicious Chinese street foods. ►For addresses a full Chengdu Food Tour, visit my blog post on Chengdu street food, it has a huge list of the best street foods to try in Chengdu, China. The Chengdu food guide features all of the locations within this Chinese street food video: ►https://www.thefoodranger.com/the-ult...In this Chinese street food tour video, we're starting out with one of China's most famous foods; DUMPLINGS. In Chengdu, they are different from the rest of China. Here, they are boiled and covered in a thick and spicy chili oil that leaves you so SATISFIED! These are some of the most satisfying dumplings ever! I must admit though, the filling could have been more plump. If you are traveling to Chengdu to eat Szechuan cuisine, I would personally recommend trying the red chili oil wontons first. And after those amazing dumplings in Chengdu, we're eating another famous dish in Sichuan cuisine, RABBIT. Eating rabbit is very famous in Sichuan, and here in Chengdu, locals love it in a numbing and spicy Szechuan Sauce. But we wanted to try a more UNIQUE style of eating rabbit in Sichuan, on top of noodles. So we visited a local rabbit noodle joint and ate a couple unique bowls of Chinese Sichuan noodles. The first was the rabbit noodles, where the rabbit is served to you in thin slices covered in chilies, ginger, and onions. You then pour it over top of your thick and spicy chili oil broth noodle bowl. It was absolutely delicious. The next bowl of spicy noodles that we ordered was the beef noodle soup - red braised beef noodle soup. Super delicious and spicy!After eating those 2 bowls of delicious Sichuan noodles, we are bringing you to a nice original fly restaurant of Chengdu, Mingting fandian. The fly restaurants of Chengdu are old locations that are sometimes less than cleanly but have incredible food! Nowadays most fly restaurants in Chengdu are actually really clean and you don't have to worry about getting sick from eating the street food. At mingting restaurant, we ordered a river carp,  spicy pork blood, spare ribs, fried sticky rice strips, Sichuan sausages, twice cooked pork, and pig brain tofu. It was all incredibly delicious!And for our final meal in this Chinese street food tour of Chengdu, China, we're going for one of the most famous foods to try in Sichuan, HOT POT! We found a local 9 section hot pot that serves spicy and delicious hot pot and is always busy!

This is Sichuan Food HEAVEN!In this Chinese Street Food Tour video, we’re bringing you in DEEP to try 4 amazing Chinese street foods in Chengdu. Here, the Sichuan food is world famous for being SPICY, Fragrant, and a little numbing as well from the Sichuan peppercorn.Today, we’re going for a street food adventure to these 4 street food stalls to taste some delicious and spicy street foods and also a famous Sichuan dessert.We’re starting first thing in the morning for Chinese breakfast and going to a famous Sichuan Noodle Joint in Chengdu. This noodle restaurant is famous for its twice cooked pork noodles AKA huiguoroumian 回锅肉面.Huiguorou twice cooked pork is a famous Sichuan food that is best in Chengdu. And to find it on top of noodles is very RARE. To me it’s like an upgraded dan dan noodle. The flavour is even stronger and more aromatic. And we were so lucky to get into the kitchen to watch the chef Mr.Yu cook his family recipe and serve it to us!After this, we found the true Chinese Street Food LEVEL 9000 dish, the sweet sticky rice balls AKA Tangyou Guozi 糖油果子. Tangyou guozi are a very traditional Chinese street food in Chengdu that you need to try. The sticky rice balls are fried in a huge wok full of oil for about 10 minutes and then covered in a dark sweet molasses. They are crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside, and are incredibly sweet!After this, we’re continuing our journey for another famous Chinese street food - WONTONS. And today, we got invited into the prep area of a famous wonton restaurant in a little neighbourhood of Chengdu. This restaurant serves a variety of special wontons famous in Sichuan cuisine. Watching the master chefs prepare these elegant and expensive wontons was a highlight of our Chinese street food adventure. They are most well known for their ganhaijiao chaoshou AKA spicy wontons covered in peanut and chili. You can order them dry or with stock. I prefer them dry. They also had two other amazing wonton dishes, one made with pork and another made with shrimp, pork, and crab egg, kind of like a Seafood wonton! Each of these were made with a chicken stock and served with either matsutake mushrooms or local fungus. And to finish off our Chinese street food LEVEL 9000 Adventure - we’re going to the most famous Szechuan food of all, the Szechuan hot pot! Here in Chengdu, you can get extremely spicy and flavourful Sichuan hot pot almost anywhere. But we set out to find the most local style one and found a little place in a small neighbourhood in Chengdu. It was definitely one of the BEST hot pot restaurants in Chengdu! It was very spicy and flavourful and full of chili and Sichuan peppercorn!All the addresses for this Chinese Street Food LEVEL 9000 Tour of Sichuan China are found in my Chengdu Food Tour Post here: https://www.thefoodranger.com/the-ult...You can follow along on the Chengdu food tour map and take yourself on a Foodrangin’ adventure!

n19N6bECRQM,Tokyo's Monster Food Challenge ★ ONLY in JAPAN #20 東京大食いチャレンジ,"Japan is the last place you'd think to find gigantic portions of food, but you'll be surprised to hear that many restaurants offer food challenges! Sometimes what you've given just isn't enough, right? Best of all, if you eat it all within a certain amount of time, it's usually free! John Daub and Kai Okudara head to Iidabashi Station and the Kagurazaka Hanten (神楽坂飯店) restaurant known for its jumbo gyoza and other food challenges. It's a 10 min walk from the Tokyo Dome or 1 stop on the Oedo Line subway. Most people notice the challenge in the display window. It looks almost like a joke! It's ridiculously big. THE CHALLENGE: ★ Jumbo Gyoza / 2.5kg. / 60 minutes / ￥9600 ★ Triple Jumbo Ramen / 3.2kg. / 60 minutes / ￥1890* It's free if you complete the challenge* Jumbo Gyoza should be ordered 2 days in advance * Enter the Wall of Fame if you complete the challengeWhy are food portions in Japanese usually small? We talk about the Japanese concept of mottainai もったいない which means ""take only what you need"" and ""don't waste"" This concept runs deep with Japanese and is followed closely with almost every citizen. Kagurazaka Hanten started this challenge 45 years ago as a PR stunt for students. It was a way to get them in to the restaurant in groups and have fun. Today, the restaurant is featured often on Japanese TV as Japanese talent test the limits of their stomachs. ★ Watch Other ONLY in JAPAN FOOD CHALLENGES ★ ☆ Highway Rest Area Food Challenge https://youtu.be/ZSm1InvSMBA☆ Stinky Sushi Eating Challenge https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI5Jv...☆ Ice Cream Flavor Challenge https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP-B1...URL: Kai's Instagram: http://instagram.com/sneakermaniaKagurazaka Hanten (神楽坂飯店) telephone: 03-3260-1402This show has been created and produced by John Daub.

vPVqo3MvfVo,"Italian Food - AMAZING ROMAN FOOD and Attractions in Rome, Italy!","Join me on this incredible Italian food tour in Rome!►Subscribe to my videos: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe►Watch the full series playlist: https://goo.gl/179qoF►Camera gear I use: https://goo.gl/68UlWdDay 14 on our Round The World Trip for Food: Rome, Italy - On our very first day in Rome, we set off early in the morning to see some of the most famous attractions in Rome, including the Colosseum and the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill. After doing some more sightseeing and having lunch, we had an amazing Roman food at a restaurant in Rome called Trattoria Dal Cavalier Gino.00:37 Breakfast at the hotel - To begin the day of sightseeing in Rome, we had breakfast at the hotel, and did the final planning of the day.2:12 Colosseum - One of the most important and well recognized attractions in Rome is the Colosseum and we arrived pretty early to get in, and I also had pre-purchased my tickets online to attempt to beat the crowds and not have to waste time waiting in line. It worked well, and as soon as the Colosseum opened, we went through security and got in. It was an amazing sight to see, especially because it was so quiet when we arrived.3:51 Roman Forum and Palatine Hill - Locate in the same area as the Colosseum is the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill, and so that’s where we went next. Again, seeing the ancient ruins of Rome was truly spectacular. 5:48 Trattoria Luzzi - I wasn’t quite sure where to eat lunch, and located right around these famous attractions in Rome, there are a lot of expensive, and probably not so good restaurants. We decided to go check out a restaurant called Trattoria Luzzi, just down the road from the Colosseum on the opposite side of the road. I ordered Trippa Alla Romana, a Roman tripe dish and also a pasta of Amatriciana. Overall, the food was good, and it was a friendly little restaurant and the location was good. Total price - 21 EUR ($23.47).10:31 Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano - After lunch we headed to Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano, a huge basilica in Rome. Right across the plaza is Scala Sancta, a small chapel with a 28 step staircase where Jesus is believed to have ascended. 13:25 Gelateria Valentino - I don’t know of anyone that goes to Rome without eating some gelato, and right around the Trevi fountain area of Rome, you’ll find a lot of gelato spots. We tried Gelateria Valentino. Gelato - 3 EUR ($3.35)14:50 Trevi Fountain - Another one of the most iconic attractions in Rome is the Trevi fountain. We didn’t spend too much time there, but it is pretty cool to see in person.16:25 Amazing Italian Roman food at Trattoria Dal Cavalier Gino Restaurant - For dinner, my wife and I met up with Valentina and Antonio. After walking through the amazing narrow lanes of Rome, we navigated our way to Trattoria Dal Cavalier Gino Restaurant, where they had made a reservation for dinner. The restaurant is exactly what you want in a classic Roman Italian food restaurant, a family style restaurant that offers an abundance of Roman dishes. We first started with some types of Roman pasta including cacio e pepe, and carbonara, all of which were incredible - the best pastas I’ve ever had. Then we moved on the an amazing assortment of main Italian food dishes, including veal, lamb, and so many other amazing dishes. It was an Italian food meal like I’ve never had before. Most of the dishes were Roman food style. Thank you Valentina and Antonio for the amazing dinner!Day 14 in Rome was an amazing day of visiting some of the most famous attractions in Rome and eating some incredibly delicious Italian food!Disclaimer and Thank You: Thank you to Star Alliance and their Round The World tickets (http://www.staralliance.com/en/round-...) for sponsoring my business class flights.

With a proper diet plan where you're eating the right foods in the right amounts you'll strip off layer after layer of body fat and say goodbye to that belly forever. However, if you're eating the wrong things you'll only be setting yourself back further and further. With an improper diet plan you'll have to get used to loosening your belt notch after notch because your belly fat will be there to stay. So to ensure that you aren't making any mistakes with the food you're selecting I want to go over the 20 best foods that you should be eating regularly to lose that belly fat for good. The first food I want to start with is the avocado. Unlike other fruits that are loaded with carbs, Avocados are full of healthy monounsaturated fats specifically oleic acid. They are also full of fiber which will help you feel full for longer. Another great thing about avocados that was discovered during a study from The Ohio State University at Columbus is that avocados help you absorb more cartenoids from fruits and vegetables, up to 15x more to be exact. So not only will avocados help you burn fat, but you'll also be strengthening your immune system and absorbing more cancer fighting cartenoids than ever. Next we have eggs. Eggs are great to incorporate into your diet plan because they’re high in protein, high in healthy fats and they can help you feel full for a very low amount of total calories. Eggs are also one of the most bioavailable sources of protein out there. Meaning that your body can very efficiently digest, absorb, and assimilate the protein found in eggs. Having a solid protein source like eggs in your diet will help you prevent muscle loss while you eat less calories to create enough of a deficit to burn fat. Lets move on to one of the best fruits you can eat while trying to lose belly fat...berries. Compared to most other fruits berries are very low in carbohydrates, while being full in vitamins and antioxidants. These antioxidants can help improve blood flow delivering more oxygen to your muscles and your cells in general. Ultimately this can hep improve your workouts while assisting with the fat loss process. The best low carb berries to eat are blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries. Blueberries are going to be a bit higher in carbs, so to keep calories low stick with the other 3. The next food isn't really a food, but instead its a drink that's been proven very effective at helping you fight that belly fat...apple cider vinegar. Apple cider vinegar has been shown to help people lose weight and waist circumference. These aren't they typical animal studies that you constantly see that don't necessarily guarantee the same results for people. Instead these are human studies. One of these studies was 12 weeks long and it demonstrated that obese individuals could lose anywhere from 2.6 to 3.7 pounds just by consuming 1 to 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar per day. It has also been shown to improve blood sugar spikes after meals, and it can help increase fullness after a meal. In fact one study showed that taking apple cider vinegar with a high carb meal could result in people eating 200 to 275 less calories for the day. Keep in mind, you want to make sure that you dilute only one to two tablespoons of the apple cider vinegar in water. Don't drink it straight up. Next I have another high protein food for you and that's tuna. Tuna is a very lean fish that's pretty much entirely made up of protein. This makes tuna a great option to increase protein intake without increasing calorie intake too much. The important thing is if you're buying canned tuna you want to make sure you get the tuna in water not oil. If you get it in oil then all the extra calories that you save from this low fat fish will be canceled out. Fish in general is a great option for when you're trying to burn fat",food

IQw5UOVvDj4,"Malaysian Food in Melaka - SPECIAL SATAY + Asam Pedas and Chicken Rice Balls | Malacca, Malaysia!","Watch more Malaysian food videos: https://youtu.be/u5LYl4DM5c4Subscribe http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe for 2 new videos every weekT-shirts and caps: https://goo.gl/6WdK1lMELAKA, MALAYSIA - Malaysian Food Tour!Melaka (also sometimes spelled Malacca) is a beautiful city in southern Malaysia, significant in history, packed with delicious food, and again, like most of Malaysia, a melting pot of cultures, peoples and foods.Here’s what we ate in this food tour of Melaka, Malaysia:Kedai Kopi Chung Wah - One of the foods you have to eat in Melaka is Hainanese chicken rice balls. The rice is cooked with chicken broth like most chicken rice, but instead of just a plate of rice, you get little fish ball shaped rice balls, along with chicken. It’s an iconic dish, but it’s pretty delicious and makes a wonderful breakfast.Total price - 29 MYR ($7.12)Asam Pedas Pak Man - Asam pedas is sour spicy, and you’ll find variations of it across much of Southeast Asia, but Melaka is quite famous for it within Malaysia. We went to Asam Pedas Pak Man, a stall set up within a local Malaysian food court. I ordered a variety of different plates, each asam pedas but with a different fish. All were spectacular. It looks extremely spicy, but it’s not actually all that spicy, however it is extremely tasty and full of herbs and chilies and flavor. Best Malaysian food dish of the day in Melaka for me.Total price - 75 MYR ($18.39)Klebang Original Coconut Shake - This was pretty ordinary for me, nothing spectacular, but again it’s one of those things most people try in Melaka.Total price - 9.90 MYR ($2.43)Ban Lee Siang Satay Celup - Next up, satay celup, a unique Melaka style satay where you choose your own skewers and boil them in the sauce right in the middle of your table. For me honestly, satay celup is too sweet, but I have to admit it’s a lot of fun to eat and cook, and very social.Total price - 34 MYR ($8.34)Ikan Bakar Haji Masu - Finally to end this Malaysian food tour in Melaka (Malacca), we went to a seafood, ikan bakar (grilled fish) restaurant. There are quite a few huge seafood restaurants in Melaka, but I wanted one that was kind of small and laid back. Ikan Bakar Haji Masu was fantastic, and I think the best thing was their grilled fish.Total price - 99 MYR ($24.27)Thank you for watching this Malaysian food tour in Melaka.

TALAD KAO MARKET: Mrs. Pan’s Bug CartADDRESS: Soi Lat Krabang 5, Lat Krabang, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10520OPEN: 2PM - 10PM 🦗The night before Mrs. Pan cooks the bugs she will later sell in the market, her son goes to Khlong Toei, Bangkok’s largest wet market, to purchase a variety of insects. She begins cooking each morning in order to make it to the market and set up her cart by 2pm. To cook the bugs, Mrs. Pan first adds oil and chopped pandan leaves to a frying pan. The pandan leaves add a nice fragrance to the bugs while cutting the bitter taste. She adds her first round of bugs and allows them to fry for roughly 30 minutes. She allows the crickets to cook for only 15 minutes. To enhance the flavors, she does not clean the pan between bugs. Then she’s off to the market, to fill hungry bellies with bugs! 💸PRICE: 1.50 USD/50 THB for Mixed Bowl of Bugs 1.20 USD/40 THB for Giant Water Bug2. TOY KUAY TEOW: Boat Noodles (Blood Noodle Soup)ADDRESS: 15 Ratchawithi Rd, Khwaeng Thung Phaya Thai, Khet Ratchathewi, Krung Thep Maha NakhonOPEN: 8AM - 6PM🍜Toy Kuay Teow has been serving up boat noodles for 50 years and is on its third generation. To make one of Bangkok’s most beloved noodle soups, combine chilli dressing, pork, meatballs, vermicelli noodles, pork blood, pork soup, scallions and herbs, bok choy, fried pork skin and fried flat noodles (optional). Beef boat noodles include beef blood, rather than pork blood.💸PRICE: .46 USD/15 THB for a small bowl.91 USD/30 THB for a normal bowl3. J'KHAI SEAFOOD: Horseshoe Crab EggsADDRESS: 1300/3-4 Prachachuen Road, Bangsue BangkokOPEN: 3PM - 12AM J’Khai Seafood started when the owner began selling food from a small cart 34 years ago. It is now a multi-story restaurant in Bangkok, and their signature “Thai curry steamed horseshoe crab eggs” recently won Wongnai Users’ Choice for best dish. 🦀To make this tasty meal, they first steam the horseshoe crab, cutting open the lower part of the crab to remove all of the eggs. Separately, create the seasoning, mixing Thai red curry paste, sugar, MSG, oyster sauce and carnation milk. Add the seasoning to an oiled, heated pan before adding chicken egg and finger root. Allow to stir-fry for a bit, then scoop everything back into the horseshoe crab shell. Take the horseshoe crab and grill it over hot charcoal until bubbling. Top it off with coconut milk, sliced lime leaves and carrots before diving in. 💸PRICE: 15 USD/500 THB per Horseshoe Crab (may vary) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -💬COME SAY HI:INSTAGRAM » http://bit.ly/InstaSonnySideFACEBOOK » http://bit.ly/BEFRSFacebook💗SUPPORT OUR MISSION: Patreon is a platform that allows people to support creators on a recurring basis.

From the moment I arrived and started eating fermented durian, fermented fish sauce, and tons of different curries, I knew it was amazing place.We met up with Pet, head chef of Rahsia Kitchen - by the way they serve excellent Western food in Kuala Terengganu - and he took us around for the day to eat some of the best local Malay food in Terengganu.Nasi Dagang Atas Tol - When Malaysian think of Malay food in Terengganu, the number one dish they would think of, that’s associated with the state is nasi dagang. Nasi dagang is rice cooked with coconut milk and fenugreek, then served with a tuna curry. It’s an amazing dish and something you don’t want to miss. Nasi Dagang Atas Tol is also known for their bubble bath milk tea, which has suds like I’ve never seen.Price - about 3.50 MYR ($0.96) per plateLocal market and Genius Malay food - At the market we met up with Naqwit Mohammed who is a local artist and musician. He connected with Pett and I on social media, and met up with us to show us around the market since he’s from that village. The market was incredible, packed full of delicious Malaysian food, and with an incredibly friendly feel. The namu namu fruit was unique and delicious, and a first for me, and I also was fascinated by the fish mixed with coconut, then re-filled back into fish shape - this was a genius food for me. Perfect place to walk around and sample Malay foods.Singgang Budu Restaurant - For lunch we drove into Kuala Terengganu, the main city and had lunch at Singgang Budu Restaurant, know for nasi campur (mix of different dishes), eaten along with budu sauce (fermented anchovy sauce) and tempoyak (fermented durian). Great meal.Warung Pok Nong - Finally, another unique and very locally popular restaurant in Terengganu is Warung Pok Nong, known for their extreme deep fried seafood, and located along the ocean. It’s an amazing place, where you can snack on some incredibly crunchy seafood.It was amazing day of food and fun in Terengganu.

Chances are, these scandals somehow affected what you ate…it might even be affecting it now…and not for the better. Check out these 25 insane food scandals that actually happened.  We’d like to believe that what we eat is absolutely safe. Unfortunately, that’s not always the case. In many cases we don’t even know what we are eating or where it comes from. But when we find out, we are rarely satisfied. Check out these insane food scandals (and our photo credits and sources) and let us know in the comments below if you’ve heard of these scandals (and if they’ve changed the way you eat). http://list25.com/25-insane-food-scan...SUBSCRIBE - http://bit.ly/2uwq6BJFollow us on: List25 Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/list25List25 Instagram: https://instagram.com/list25/List25 Twitter - https://twitter.com/list25 List25 Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/list25/See more lists on our website:http://list25.com Do you know WHAT you are eating? You may think you are eating 100% pure food, but the answers is alarmingly different. Take the fast food restaurant Subway for example. Their chicken only contained 50% real chicken. The rest was soy fillers. But soy fillers are not too bad compared to fake eggs. In 2012, scammers in China produced eggs cheaper than the supermarket by creating a mold where they combined resin, starch, coagulant, and pigments. Talk about fake food! But wait there’s more!

_qhIT8sOymk,How Long Foods Stay In Your Stomach,"How long does the process of digestion last? Do you find yourself still hungry no matter how much you eat? If so, you might be eating foods that are too high on the glycemic index. It’s definitely something worth knowing if you’re struggling with excess weight.  The glycemic index is a system of values given to foods according to how quickly they cause an increase in blood glucose levels. To put that in layman’s terms, it basically measures how fast different foods are digested by the body. Glucose is a simple sugar that gives your body energy, and you get it from the foods you eat.Your blood is what carries this sugar throughout your body to all your hungry cells and tissues. That’s why it’s called blood glucose. If you eat something that’s high on the index, your blood glucose will spike, giving you a fast boost of energy.TIMESTAMPS: What glycemic index is 0:58Foods that digest slowly 3:30Foods that digest moderately 4:08Foods that digest quickly 4:34 Foods that don’t have a glycemic index value 5:27What about pizza? 6:09 Are all low-glycemic foods healthy? 6:43Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/SUMMARY: - The glycemic index is a system of values given to foods according to how quickly they cause an increase in blood glucose levels. To put that in layman’s terms, it basically measures how fast different foods are digested by the body.- If you eat something that’s high on the index, your blood glucose will spike, giving you a fast boost of energy.- Foods and drinks are actually split into three groups: low, medium, and high. Low items rate from 1 to 55, medium is from 56 to 69, and high items are from 70 and above.- According to the experts at Bodytomy, some low-glycemic foods, like cooked vegetables or a salad, can remain in your stomach anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour.- There are also foods that really don’t really have a glycemic index value since they don’t contain any carbs. But they can still take a while to be digested by your stomach. It can take you anywhere from 2 to 5 hours for your stomach to digest meats, like chicken, lamb, and pork.- If you’re having pizza that’s just dough, cheese, and sauce, that might rate high on the glycemic index, mostly because of that dough. But believe it or not, adding toppings actually makes your slice healthier!- You might encounter foods that will be low on the index, but if they’re processed, they most likely still contain tons of saturated fats, sugar, and empty calories.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/",food

DzuOaJ9f8qI,10 Foods You Should Never Eat,"We know some products are really dangerous for our health, and other products are good for us as they are healthy. It turns out it’s not so simple and some of the most promoted and popular foods can, in fact, harm you. Never eat these 10 dangerous foods for the sake of your own health and the health of your family. Even if you see the juice labels “not from concentrate” or “100% pure”, don't let this fool you. Juice, after being squeezed from different fruits, is kept in huge vacuum-sealed tanks where it can sit for up to a year before being packaged! And by that time, the juice has lost all its flavor, which is why manufacturers have to add artificial flavoring to make it taste fruity again.In most cases, cereals are loaded with refined carbohydrates and sugar. Even if the label assures you that it's fat-free and whole grain, check the list of ingredients. You'll most likely see that the product is full of sugar.Despite common belief, most yogurts don't contain probiotic bacteria since the process of pasteurization kills all these microorganisms. When consumed, trans-fats in ice-cream can cause high cholesterol, stroke, heart disease, and even cancer. Ice cream is also loaded with sugar, artificial flavors, and synthetic preservatives. And if it’s pink, purple, or red, it’s most likely been colored with cochineal extract or carmine, additives which can cause bad allergic reactions. Popcorn has some genetically modified ingredients as well as taste-boosting chemicals and additives. This leads to health problems such as heart attacks, digestive issues, allergies, skin rashes, breathing problems, and the depressing list goes on. Even more, popcorn is extremely caloric.Music: Vibe Mountain - Great HopeThe 126ers - Reversed EclipseRondo Brothers - Yellow GoldKevin MacLeod - Jay JaySilent Partner - Pink Lemonadehttps://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/...TIMESTAMPSFruit juices 0:37Energy bars 1:42Cereal 2:31Margarine 3:21Low-fat yogurt 4:11Ice cream 5:01Eggs 6:07Microwave popcorn 7:09Sugar-free candy 8:32Diet soda 9:26SUMMARY-Store-bought juices may contain some real fruit, but most of their content is water, sugar, and artificial flavoring.-Protein bars and energy bars alike are usually processed products containing sugar, artificial flavors and sweeteners.-Breakfast cereals typically contain a teeny tiny amount of whole grains, which allows producers to mark their product as healthy, but they also contain unhealthy sugar. -Margarine is typically made from industrial vegetable oils hydrogenated to become solid, a process that significantly increases the oils’ trans-fat content.-Manufacturers load “low-fat” yogurts with sugar to make up for the lack of taste usually provided by the natural fats.-Instead of pure milk or cream, manufacturers use cheaper hydrogenated fats such as palm- or coconut oil to produce ice-cream. These oils, when heated, become nothing more than trans-fats.-One egg contains as much cholesterol as a big greasy burger.-Microwave popcorn’s almost always lined with the same toxic substance you can find in Teflon pans.-If candy doesn’t contain sugar, it contains artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose, and saccharine. These substances are chemically processed and may cause some serious side effects.-Artificial sweeteners in diet soda can easily lead to weight gain as they trigger the production of insulin, which makes your body store fat.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/",food

RwZY1jaw2EM,Food Matters (PART 1) - First 8 Minutes,"Dear Friend,What you're about to learn could likely save your life, or that of someone you love. This was certainly the case with my Father. About 6 years ago my Father was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Depression and Anxiety. The best the medical profession could offer was a cocktail of medications to treat the symptoms and little in the way of hope for treating the underlying causes. Not surprisingly his health continued to decline.At the same time we were studying nutrition and sending my father many books we had read but these didn't seem to help convince him. So for the next 12 months (with 3 years of research up our sleeves) we set about creating the independent documentary film 'Food Matters'.'Food Matters' features interviews with leading health experts who reveal the best natural healing choices you can make for you and your family's health. In the film you'll discover what works, what doesn't and what's killing you.Needless to say after my father saw the film he quit his pharmaceutical meds, changed his diet, lost 20% of his body weight and is now running 3 times a week which is a big change from being bed ridden for 5 years!Thank you for your support in helping this lifesaving information reach more people, it would not be possible without you.James Colquhoun & Laurentine ten BoschProducer / Directors 'Food Matters'PS: You don't have to take our word for it, here is what others are saying about the film.  ""Everything I have been harping on for the last 40 years, these two have brilliantly encapsulated in one beautifully produced, eminently watchable video."" - Harvey Diamond, Author of America's best selling health book 'Fit For Life'""This film lays out the inconvenient truth the food industry doesn't want you to hear -- that nearly all degenerative disease is actually caused by the processed, nutrient-depleted food being consumed in first-world nations around the world. 'Food Matters' dares to reveal how we can stop this cycle of destruction and restore true health to ourselves and our planet."" - Mike Adams founder of Natural News.com ""Anyone who is serious about their health needs to see this stunning film.""- Christiane Northrup, MD, author of the Women's Wisdom series ""James and Laurentine provide a radiant beacon of hope with steps you can do today to take control of your health and begin healing. This is such important information - and much aligned with my personal health philosophies. It's time to get it out to everyone who will listen. I encourage you to order a copy of Food Matters today and watch it with your friends and family.""- Dr Joseph Mercola - Mercola.com",food

e2RBRUFwmuw,Indonesian Street Food Tour of Glodok (Chinatown) in Jakarta - DELICIOUS Indonesia Food!,"►Check out 50 of the Best Indonesian Dishes: https://migrationology.com/indonesian...Glodok is the Chinatown of Jakarta, and my wife and I decided to spend the day walking around Glodok and exploring some Indonesian street food throughout the day. At the end of the day, we also stopped by Fatahillah Square, with is an old Dutch square in colonial Jakarta, where you'll find some interesting buildings and some street food snacks as well.Since we were staying at a hotel (here’s information on the hotel I stayed at:https://migrationology.com/travel-gui...)  not too far from Glodok, we decided to beat the traffic and just walk over there. It didn’t take more than 15 minutes to walk, and soon we arrived in Jakarta’s Chinatown. Glodok is a very interesting area to walk around and explore. There are fresh markets and plenty of restaurants and food to choose from.The Indonesian street food I tried on this tour was siomay, an Indonesian Chinese dish. From the back of a motorbike, I chose a few of the siomay dumplings he had steaming, and the cut them up and added some peanut sauce to the plate. The texture was a little mushy, but they were alright. Right opposite the siomay, the owner of an Indonesian vegetarian restaurant greeted me and asked if I might like to eat some of his vegetarian food. His vegetarian rendang was particularly good.One of the most famous places to go in Glodok is Kopi Es Tak Kie, a legendary coffee shop. After wandering around a while we found it. I had a cup of coffee and also a plate of nasi campur from outside the shop.We continued on our Indonesian street food tour throughout Glodok and I tried a sweet snack called kue ape, which is a green colored little pancake. Next, I had a variety of deep fried snacks including fried bananas, and fried breadfruit. They are definitely pretty greasy, but interesting to sample, and they are very popular street food snacks in Indonesia.It probably wasn’t the greatest idea to walk, but we decided to walk over to Fatahillah Square. The traffic was pretty intense, but we made it. And along with checking out the old colonial buildings one of my main goals was to try kerak telor, which is a traditional Indonesian Betawi street food snack. Luckily I found it and it turned out to be a very interesting and amazing snack to watch being made!Here’s the list of the things we ate and the prices:Siomay - 15,000 IDR ($1.11)Vegetarian food - 20,000 IDR ($1.48)Kopi Es Tak Kie - 10,000 IDR ($0.73) Nasi campur - 35,000 IDR ($2.58)Kue ape - 1,000 IDR ($0.07) eachFried snacks - 12,000 ($0.88)Kerak telor - 20,000 IDR ($1.48) - Possibly overcharged? Do you think?Hope you enjoyed the Indonesian street food tour of Glodok and Fatahillah Square, I sure enjoyed eating it!--MY WEBSITES:Camera I use: https://migrationology.com/travel-res...T-shirts: https://migrationology.com/store/Migrationology.com: http://migrationology.com/EatingThaiFood.com: http://eatingthaifood.com/TravelByYing.com: http://travelbyying.com/SOCIAL MEDIA:Snapchat: @migrationologyInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology►Jakarta Travel Guide: https://migrationology.com/travel-gui...►50 of the Best Indonesian Dishes: https://migrationology.com/indonesian...--",food

Since we love street food around the world, we decided that Vietnam was the perfect holiday destination for street food to try, because it's supposed to be the best and we love watching new street food recipes and street food flavors as we adventure down deep, back alleyways, getting lost into new street food worlds.  So far, in our Vietnamese street food tour series, we've eaten street food in Hanoi, and then we took the sleeper train south 12 hours to Hue. Hue is the old ancient capital of Vietnam, and is packed full of different street food to try. We spent 4 days here eating and couldn't get enough of all the street food. Asian street food is the best, and in Vietnam, it doesn't get any better!We found 11 different Vietnamese street foods in this video. If you arrive here looking to eat, you can follow along with these addresses:1) Bun Bo hue @02:44- The specialty street food Beef and pork broth noodle soup of Hue, Vietnam - It’s absolutely rich and delicious! Found at the Dong Ba market early morning around 730am. Go to the outside of the street market and find the old ladies with big pots of good street food and you’ll discover a ton!2) Bun Hen @ 06:10 Spicy Clam noodle soup - Also found at the Dong Ba Market in Hue, Vietnam, in the early morning!

This one was at the intersection of Xuan 68 and Le Thanh Ton street inside Hue’s old city.7) Douhua Silken Tofu @ 21:27 - This was a street food vendor carrying the food on wooden poles, so you have to be lucky at the right place at the right time. We were at the location below around 4:30 PM and she came along.8) Banh Tran Truong “Vietnamese Pizza made from rice paper” @ 22:54. You can find this one inside the old city on 14 Le Thanh Ton Street in Hue, Vietnam9) Banh Ep - Flattened rice paper dough with raw egg grilled @ 22:54 - Same location as the Vietnamese rice paper pizza10) Nem Lui Vietnamese Pork Skewers @ 25:56 - These were found at 241 Huynh Thuc Khang - TP, Hue, Vietnam11) Banh Xeo Vietnamese pancakes @ 25:56 - Same location as above, 241 Hyun Thuc Khang - TP.

C5U3dMkYbog,"GIANT BEEF RIBS and Brisket - AMERICAN FOOD BBQ at Little Miss BBQ in Phoenix, AZ!","Little Miss BBQ serves unbelievable BBQ meat in Phoenix!►SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe►T-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/Phoenix, Arizona, USAFor me, one of the ultimate American food meals to eat is awesome BBQ - when the meat is smoked perfectly so it slides off the bone, and the flavor is packed full of insane smokiness. My brother in law Derek had already been to Little Miss BBQ, but it was my first time to eat here, and I was so excited.I arrived a little over an hour early to get in line, but luckily as soon as you pull up you get a number so that you don’t actually have to wait in line the entire time. Scott and the entire crew at Little Miss BBQ are amazing, and you can immediately feel their passion and their genuine love for what they do and for the people they get to interact with everyday as a result of serving the best BBQ in Phoenix! Scott and his wife have an interesting and amazing grassroots history and start to their BBQ business. They first started making BBQ at home just because they loved doing it. Eventually they started competing in American BBQ competitions. At the beginning things didn’t go so well, but they kept going and perfecting their BBQ recipes and eventually started to win some of the competitions. Eventually they opened Little Miss BBQ, and it’s one of the best BBQ spots you’ll ever eat at.So after getting the full tour of the restaurant and all the smoked meat, it was about time to open. You line up outside and the actual inside is quite small - most people either takeaway or eat outside.I wanted to try a little of everything, so we got a giant tray of smoked BBQ meat including pork ribs, pulled pork, turkey, sausage, brisket, and beef ribs, with sides. Total price for the entire tray came to $92.70 - that was a lot of meat!Thanks to my brother in law Derek for coming out to eat as well. We started with the beef ribs, and those are the best of the best. The meat falls apart and it was so insanely juicy and flavorful. The BBQ brisket will also blow you mind with its massive meaty flavor and juiciness. Finally my other top meat was the sausage, including jalapeno and a mix of meat and bacon.Lastly, you have to eat your American food bbq feast with their famous pecan pie. And even though I’m not into sweets, a few bites at the end was amazing.Little Miss BBQ is a phenomenal BBQ restaurant in Phoenix, Arizona. Not only will the quality and taste of the meat blow you away, but the passion of Scott and the entire crew are so genuine and so friendly, and that’s what makes it so good.Thank you for watching this BBQ video!MUSIC: Turn on my Swag -  https://goo.gl/HwVjdo***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzI would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyT-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/",food

bCKmQlF9-C8,Living Food Communities_Kenya_ENG,"The first Living Food Communities documentary, a series of short videos being produced by Slow Food as part of the 4Cities4Dev project, was shot in Kenya.The 23-minute production looks at the Pokot Ash Yogurt Presidium, featuring beautiful landscapes and memorable characters as it tells the story of this unique product and how it became key to the community's identity. The highland farmers talk about their traditions and livestock, their most valuable asset, with great passion and a comparison with the desperation of the city is striking. This juxtaposition restore a sense of worth to the rural subsistence economy, which in this case is able to effectively guarantee food security to the community and provides a concrete example of an integrated approach that puts food at the center of actions to protect biodiversity, community, culture and traditions.The Living Food Communities films are directed by Francesco Amato and Stefano Scarafia and edited by Paolo Casalis for the Bodà production company.Read more about the the 4cities4dev visit the website:http://www.4cities4dev.eu",food

FrboT4icoN8,Garlicky Braised Lamb Shanks with Sweet Peppers | Food & Wine,"In 2018, Food & Wine named this recipe one of our 40 best: Legendary chef Jeremiah Tower has been called the father of California cuisine, both as the chef at Chez Panisse in the 1970s then at his own magnificent San Francisco restaurant, Stars, where this lamb shank dish was first served. Rich, mellow, saucy, and supremely satisfying, it was a dish that caught diners’ eyes as it passed by their table, inspiring them to immediately order it for themselves. At Stars, Tower served the shanks with an aioli flavored with rosemary and mint, but we like to devour them as they are. Tower also advises using a heavy dutch oven just big enough to hold the shanks. The lamb can be braised a day ahead, making the meat extra tender and flavorful. The last-minute addition of fresh bell peppers injects a bright finish to the rich dish.Ingredients4 lamb foreshanks (about 5 pounds) 1 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, divided 1 teaspoon black pepper, divided 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided 12 unpeeled garlic cloves plus  24 peeled garlic cloves (from 4 heads), divided 6 fresh bay leaves 6 thyme sprigs 3 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken stock 1 large red bell pepper, cut into 1/4-inch strips 1 medium-size yellow bell pepper, cut into 1/4-inch strips 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leavesGet the recipe: https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/g...Thanks for watching!

UJyyix4mQPs,28 CRAZY FOOD HACKS AND TRICKS,"FOOD TIPS YOU HAD TO KNOW EARLIERWe don’t like to spend a lot of time on cooking that’s why we share quick dessert recipes: quick cinnamon rolls in a cup, the right way to eat Choco pie and black ice-cream.We love weird recipes that are not only delicious but may also surprise people around! We have a perfect idea of how to surprise your friends – let’s decorate the cake with vegan caviar! This idea is really easy to make. Take a pan and pour water into it, add sriracha and agar-agar and mix these ingredients. Simmer agar-agar and sriracha for two minutes. Take a tall glass and pour vegetable oil, put into the fridge and let cool. When the vegetable oil is cold, take a syringe and squeeze out spheres of the hot mixture into the cold oil. You will see bead shapes appearing that will sink to the bottom of the glass. To separate the oil from pearls wash them with some water. Now you have fake caviar to decorate a cake or everything you like!One more cool idea is to cook black ice-cream! It’s a worldwide trend to use charcoal almost everywhere – as a beauty product, as an ingredient for different masks and also you can add it while cooking. The recipe of black ice-cream: take a bowl and add heavy cream, sugar and activated charcoal. Beat the mixture and add dry rice. And mix again. This perfect dessert will amaze your friends!Moreover, you will learn shocking food facts you had to know earlier:-Apples that you can buy in the supermarket are usually covered with wax that keeps them shiny and fresh for a long time. Don’t forget to wash the wax off before eating-Few drops of iodine will show if the mayonnaise you bought in the supermarket is natural-A glass of hot water will help you to distinguish real butter from margarine. As high-quality butter is made from cream or milk and it will melt in water unlike the margarineFinally, we share with you a trick to prank your friends: put strawberry into bleach and the color will disappear. But don’t eat these strawberries!TIMESTAMPS:00:09 White strawberry trick00:40 Homemade black ice cream04:00 Quick way to peel tomatoes05:18 How to make dried herbs05:56 Perfect cinnamon rolls09:43 How to check if your honey is natural----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/5min.crafts/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/5.min.crafts/Twitter: https://twitter.com/5m_craftsSubscribe to 5-Minute Crafts GIRLY: https://goo.gl/fWbJqzSubscribe to 5-Minute Crafts KIDS: https://goo.gl/PEuLVtSubscribe to 5-Minute Crafts MEN: http://bit.ly/2S69VUGThe Bright Side of Youtube: https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.meMusic by Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com/",food

pBPXxO9E-fQ,West African Food - EXOTIC DELICACY in GHANA!,"►SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe►T-shirts and caps available now: https://migrationology.com/store/Bushmeat is a term that is used to often describe wild game meat in Africa. And while there some types of bushmeat that are not good or unsafe to eat - grasscutter - also known as a greater cane rat, is safe and one of the most popular types of bushmeat to eat in West Africa. It’s a delicacy!So while we were driving on our way to Elmina, Ghana, along the side of the highway, we stopped at some hunters, and bought a grasscutter. Later in the day, we met up with our host family, and we drove over to the Elmina fishing market. The market was amazing, bright and colorful, and energetic, with some unique fish and seafood available from the Atlantic. We bought some fish to go along with our grasscutter, and then we continued back to the house to start cooking.First for lunch, Mama made us a dish called Eto, a mash up of yam and palm nut oil, topped with eggs. It was a little on the dry side for me, but it was an honor to have a chance to try that special Ghanaian dish.For dinner we prepared the fish and grasscutter. The fish was made into Ghanaian groundnut or peanut soup, which is one of the best dishes I at in Ghana. The grasscutter was made into a bushmeat grasscutter light soup which included chilies, garlic, onions, ginger, and tomato.Finally, for the main start of the meal Mama made omo tuo, Ghana style rice balls.How does grasscutter taste? The greater cane rats run around the fields and eat grass, so unsurprisingly some parts kind of taste like grass. But they are a white meat, and have a similar look to chicken, but the meat is even sweeter. It was also surprisingly fall apart tender. I thought it was amazing!Across West African food, grasscutter is a very popular meat, and a delicacy eaten on special occasions.MUSIC: https://artlist.io/***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzI would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyT-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/",food

5RwIWGkMxrE,Food Fight: How Corporations Ruined Food (Food Industry Documentary) - Real Stories,"When we walk into a supermarket, we assume that we have the widest possible choice of healthy foods. But in fact, over the course of the 20th century, our food system was co-opted by corporate forces whose interests do not lie in providing the public with fresh, healthy, sustainably-produced food.Fortunately for America, an alternative emerged from the counter-culture of California in the late 1960s and early 1970s, where a group of political anti-corporate protesters–led by Alice Waters–voiced their dissent by creating a food chain outside of the conventional system. The unintended result was the birth of a vital local-sustainable-organic food movement which has brought back taste and variety to our tables.FOOD FIGHT is a fascinating look at how American agricultural policy and food culture developed in the 20th century, and how the California food movement has created a counter-revolution against big agribusiness.Want to watch more full-length Documentaries?

2ZQ7I7rvwls,Japanese Street Food - BLUEFIN TUNA CUTTING SHOW & SUSHI / SASHIMI MEAL,"Bluefin tuna is one of the most highly prized fish used in Japanese raw fish dishes. About 80% of the caught Atlantic and Pacific bluefin tunas are consumed in Japan. The fish is renowned for fetching high bids at the first auction of the year in Tokyo's Tsukiji Market. The world’s most expensive fish is the 222-kilogram bluefin tuna that sold for $1.8 Million (155.4 million yen) in January 2017.In this video, a large tuna is separated into sections of differing grades and prepared into a delicious sushi meal.Japanese began eating tuna sushi in the 1840s, when a large catch came into Edo [old Tokyo] one season. A chef marinated a few pieces in soy sauce and served it as nigiri sushi. At that time, these fish were nicknamed shibi — ""four days"" — because chefs would bury them for four days to mellow their bloody taste.",food

The tag, which would appear on the packaging, also could be used to determine if medications and other perishable products were still active or fresh, they said.

7pcJK1Eciwo,21 Fun Food Designs!,"We all know parents tell us from a very early age not to play with our food. But you’re older now and you don’t always have to restrict your life to what you were ordered to as a child. So take that newly found freedom and mess about with your food once in awhile--food can be incredibly versatile visually if you know how to use it, just like whoever made this probably delicious rendition of Han Solo’s best friend out of noodles, rice and leafy greens. Subscribe to Knowledge Feed for awesome mysteries, discoveries, fun topics and all around AWESOME videos !7. Dead Man Burgers  Sure this burger verges on the violent side, but the cartoonish faces the food makes kinda makes up for it. Kinda. What’s better is that making these don’t call for overly complicated ingredients or methods. It’s all the stuff you would regularly put in a burger, just with a little more effort and energy. But really, how hard is it to make mustard and ketchup eyes? What’s even better, other than the fact this particular photo is that of a vegan burger, is that depending if you’re a fan of lots of ketchup on your burgers, you can make it as messy as you want. If you wanted to do the most, you could also carve teeth into the hamburger buns and up the ketchup slathering. The only out of the ordinary thing you would need is a gingerbread cookie cut out.6. Dog Eat Dog  This is the much more scaredy-cat friendly alternative to the man eating burger. Mayumi, who runs the blog “taste of japan”  made these hot dog eating puppies by first shaping the buns and baking them herself, complete with cute black bean noses and eyes.5. Panda Curry  A plate of curry’s never looked more adorable. These rice balls wrapped in seaweed swimming towards a lake of food is too cute to eat--though it looks pretty good to eat, too. It seems that rice balls are really versatile foods and are always incorporated into cute food art ideas.4. Sugarcube Skulls  There’s nothing more ordinary than your everyday cup of joe. So if you want to spice things up in the morning and you’re inclined towards the more gothic and creepy, you can use these cool skull and bones shaped sugar pieces instead of regular cubes, packets or spoonfuls of the stuff. Artist Snow Violent came up with these bones shaped sugar cubes under their Sugar Skulls series. And honestly, edible art is the best kind of art. Or edible anything, really.3. Finger Sandwiches  Literally, these are finger sandwiches. Online, you’ll find the recipe for these snacks up the name of “Creepy, Dead Man’s Fingers Sandwiches. They seem strangely real, but they’re apparently really easy to make. All you need is bread (any kind of your choosing) butter, a spread like cream cheese or peanut butter, almonds for the fingernails and strawberry jam for the bloody mess. Actually, it sounds like it would taste quite fine, even if it looks creepy.",food

kNbDdhvwn9c,5 Foods That Help Prevent Cancer | Healthy Food,"Watch more How to Eat Healthy Food videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/501149-...There are five great foods that help prevent cancer that you can startadding in right away.  The first one is antioxidant rich berries.Blueberries, cranberries, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, they'reall little antioxidant rich nuggets.  So start adding those in, especiallythe organic versions.  Those are the best ones.Another group of foods that are great anti cancer foods are foods that arerich in vitamin D.  Vitamin D is really more of a hormone than a vitamin,but it's super important when it comes to boosting all of the anti cancerfighting cells in your body.So if you eat animal foods, you'll definitely love wild salmon, which isrich in vitamin D.  But also, button mushrooms are the only vegetable thatwill add vitamin D to your diet.  And, you want to be sure that you'regetting your vitamin sunshine.  Sunshine is really the best, most effectiveway to get vitamin D into your body.Another great anti cancer food is tea.  Green tea, black tea, white tea,even decaffeinated tea has flavonoids in it.  And flavonoids are wonderfulcompounds that help your body fight against cancer cells.Another cancer fighting food that you want to incorporate everyday iscruciferous vegetables.  Cruciferous is just a big fancy word for foods,vegetables, that grow in a cross formation.  That's the crucifer.  So, youwant to incorporate foods like broccoli, kale, cabbage, bok choy.  All ofthose are in the crucifer vegetable family. even brussel sprouts.The most powerful cruciferous vegetable are, actually, broccoli sprouts.So, you can start sprouting your own broccoli seeds at home and growingthem until they have two or three tiny leaves on them.  Those, actually,have more cancer fighting compounds in them than eating lots and lots ofcups of cooked or raw broccoli.  So go ahead and find yourself somebroccoli sprouts and eating those everyday.Now the last cancer fighting foods are cumin and turmeric.  Now these foodsare, actually, wonderful anti inflammatory ingredients that you can thatyou can start incorporating into your savory dishes.  And, antiinflammatory foods are really great in help your body to protect againstcancer.  Any inflammation response you have will help cancer cells proliferate and grow, so we want to keep you in an anti inflammatory stateby incorporating those on a regular basis.",food

exqcb4DFhzo,Fake Food YOU Eat Every Day!,"Check out this fake food we eat every day! From fake cheese to fake steak, this top 10 list of unhealthy processed food is a real scam! Subscribe For New Videos! http://goo.gl/UIzLeBWatch our ""Most MYSTERIOUS Lost Worlds On Earth!"" video here: https://youtu.be/oX1rLjFYseAWatch our ""Most CREEPY Things Found Frozen In Ice!"" video here: https://youtu.be/HaiYn6wpTPQWatch our ""Most SCARY Mythical Creatures Ever!"" video here: https://youtu.be/LEvBTkPo2R4#10 Prime MeatThe prime cut meats that smaller restaurants and corporations sell are one of the biggest complaints that high-end chefs and physicians make. That’s because ‘prime cut’ suggests that it is a single cut of the best meat from the animal.But this isn’t the case in many restaurants. Actually, what if I told you they chop up all the leftover meat and glue it back together? Does the word transglutaminase ring a bell? This is the name for the meat glue they use to glue the low quality meat back together to make you think you’re getting a full piece. This is more than a lie, this is disgusting. Besides the fact that it is using the worst tiny cuts of meat, it’s made from ammonia. The stuff used in fertilizers and oven cleaners. They try to fight back by claiming it kills E Coli, which should not be something we should be worried about being on meat anyway. Justifying making people unknowingly eat ammonia just so they can pass off scrap meat does not seem ethical in the least. Be very careful where you eat your steak! See, this is why being a vegetarian seems like a safer option! Or maybe seafood….#9 Imitation CrabOr maybe not seafood. For one, crustaceans feed off the worst possible debris on the bottom of the ocean. The only nastier creature is shrimp. This stuff they eat doesn’t magically disappear when they are caught and cooked either. There’s still…stuff in it that we eat…secondhand.Nevertheless, it’s expensive to buy fresh crab and shrimp, but you can get crab cakes and other delicacies at the grocery store for a pretty good price. Why? It’s usually because it is fake, under the guise of imitation crab meat.Imitation crab meat is made from the remains of other fish that are mushed together, and injected into a mold. They mince and mince random fish, whatever they can get their hands on, until it turns into the same texture as crab. It is then created into a paste that is frozen and then shaved into crab-like flakes. To make it taste like crab, they just add flavor and paint it to look like crab. So, next time you go for some cheap crab, remember that’s probably, beaten, frozen, shaved, and painted fish remains. I kind of like imitation crab but not really a fan of this process...it still tastes good so if you’re okay with this…then go ahead. #8 Parmesan CheeseParmesan cheese is delicious! Especially, real authentic parmesan cheese. But did you know that companies will usually lie about what’s in “parmesan”?The FDA regulations make it legal to sell fake Parmesan cheese. This is some scary stuff. There are two huge deal breakers with parmesan. One is grated parmesan in the shaker. Most of the time, cellulose and mold inhibitor chemicals are added so it won’t clump. Cellulose, not cellulite, that’s just an after effect. Cellulose comes from ground up wood pulp and is considered “harmless and organic matter”. They usually add 2-4% cellulose, but the FDA doesn’t restrict it. In fact, some has been proven to carry 20%! That’s a lot of cellulose on your pasta! The saddest part is, this is just allowed in the United States. Parmesan cheese legally means the kind of cheese that comes from Parma, Italy. But in the US, you can call it parmesan when it’s just dehydrated, grated mozzarella.This is like the Kobe beef of cheeses. Most of the time, when you get parmesan, it’s not parmesan. It’s cellulose and a mixture of cheap cheeses.#7 Egg SubstituteThis one is a little different. No one knows what it is, but many believe that it’s a great substitute for people with egg allergies. But really, it’s still just eggs. They take mostly egg whites, fresh, frozen, or powdered, and add other ingredients. But not much. They actually just contain 99% egg whites! There’s not actually much substituting going on. It might be easier for people who don’t want to go to the trouble dealing with egg shells and yolks slipping everywhere, etc. In reality, it is called egg substitute because of that 1% that’s just artificial coloring,  salt, onion powder, and who knows what else. Why? Why would they just flavor egg whites? “Egg substitute” is kind of misleading and should be for people with egg allergies who need a substitute. It shouldn’t just be eggs. Maybe it’s substituting something else? Is it the bottle substituting for the shell? Bottom line is…this isn’t egg substitute, it’s just expensive eggs.",food

There are the food and fruit we use everyday. Let 's watched how it 's processing.Thank you for watching and Hope you enjoy with this.Food processing is the transformation of raw ingredients, by physical or chemical means into food, or of food into other forms. Food processing combines raw food ingredients to produce marketable food products that can be easily prepared and served by the consumer. Food processing typically involves activities such as mincing and macerating, liquefaction, emulsification, and cooking (such as boiling, broiling, frying, or grilling); pickling, pasteurization, and many other kinds of preservation; and canning or other packaging. (Primary-processing such as dicing or slicing, freezing or drying when leading to secondary products are also included.)A machine is a tool containing one or more parts that uses energy to perform an intended action. Machines are usually powered by chemical, thermal, or electrical means, and are often motorized. Historically, a power tool also required moving parts to classify as a machine. However, the advent of electronics has led to the development of power tools without moving parts that are considered machines=========================Amazing food processing machine #3=========================Special thanks to:Source: 1.

go_QOzc79Uc,Teach every child about food | Jamie Oliver,"http://www.ted.com Sharing powerful stories from his anti-obesity project in Huntington, W. Va., TED Prize winner Jamie Oliver makes the case for an all-out assault on our ignorance of food.Jamie Oliver is transforming the way we feed ourselves, and our children. Jamie Oliver has been drawn to the kitchen since he was a child working in his father's pub-restaurant. He showed not only a precocious culinary talent but also a passion for creating (and talking about) fresh, honest, delicious food. In the past decade, the shaggy-haired ""Naked Chef"" of late-'90s BBC2 has built a worldwide media conglomerate of TV shows, books, cookware and magazines, all based on a formula of simple, unpretentious food that invites everyone to get busy in the kitchen. And as much as his cooking is generous, so is his business model -- his Fifteen Foundation, for instance, trains young chefs from challenged backgrounds to run four of his restaurants.Now, Oliver is using his fame and charm to bring attention to the changes that Brits and Americans need to make in their lifestyles and diet. Campaigns such as Jamie's School Dinner, Ministry of Food and Food Revolution USA combine Olivers culinary tools, cookbooks and television, with serious activism and community organizing -- to create change on both the individual and governmental level.Join Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution: http://www.jamieoliver.com/campaigns/...TEDTalks is a daily video podcast of the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes.

iBznPAx6ZJY,Dutch Foods To Try,"Dutch Foods To Try - There are a lot of delicious foods to try in The Netherlands so we put together our own little DIY Dutch food tour to try as many as possible. One special Dutch food to try in The Netherlands is poffertjes - also known as the world’s cutest little pancakes. They are teeny tiny, fluffy, and melt in your mouth. They taste heavenly and you shouldn't miss trying them because they are seriously delicious and unique. I loved seeing how they’re made fresh to order in a poffertjespan. I found watching how they are flipped over super quickly was a bit hypnotic. You can get them with all sorts of toppings. My personal choice was chocolate sauce and powdered sugar. You generally order these by the dozen and you could eat as many and hardly notice because they’re so light and airy, unlike American pancakes. These Dutch cuties were one of my favourite things we tried in The Netherlands. A lot of Dutch snack foods are deep fried. One of the most popular is called a frikandel. It’s basically a minced-meat, skinless sausage that’s deep fried. Very similar to a hot dog. Personally the best part of this snack for me was the sauce. The ‘frinkandel speciaal’ is eaten with mayonnaise, curry ketchup, and chopped onion. It has a nice sweet taste. Another popular Dutch snack food is called a kaassouffle (cheese souffle). It’s melted cheese, usually Gouda, inside a doughy wrap that’s then deep fried. Cheese is important in The Netherlands and eaten widely. I have yet to see a Dutch refrigerator without a huge block of Gouda in it. Along with the poffertjes, the kaassouffle was my favourite Dutch snack food we tried. It’s pretty much deep fried cheese so what’s not to love?Krokets are a Dutch food you’ll see everywhere and they look similar at first glance to a kaassouffle. A kroket is usually cylindrical and filled with meat. As you might have guessed, it’s also deep fried. It’s long been an economical way to use leftovers of meat stew and roasts which are then mixed with gravy, rolled into logs, breaded, and fried. It became really popular during World War II as a cheap food. It’s crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Stroopwaffel is quintessentially Dutch. It means syrup waffle and is made by baking a thin waffle and, while it’s still warm, breaking it in two. Then a warm caramel-like filling is added before the two halves are pushed back together, using the syrup as glue. They’re very popular to eat on their own or with other sweets. We also tried Surinamese and Javanese food, which is widely available in The Netherlands. Suriname and Indonesia were colonized by the Dutch and I was excited to try this type of food as I had never seen it before. My sample dish came with chicken, potato, hard boiled egg, noodles with peanut sauce, rice, vegetables and bread. For dessert, we had a deep fried banana with peanut sauce. I also tried a Surinamese soda called Cherry Bouquet but it was way too sweet for me - even though I have a massive sweet tooth. I included fries in this video even though they’re Belgian, not Dutch. But they’re really popular in The Netherlands and I didn’t think I could make a video about foods to try there without including fries. Make sure you try them with lots of different sauces. My favourite is truffle mayonnaise followed closely by curry mayonnaise. I hope that you enjoyed seeing these different Dutch foods to try in The Netherlands. I’d love to know which food you’d most like to try if you had the opportunity. Or, if you’ve already tried them, which is your favourite?Subtitles available in English and Spanish!

awtmTJW9ic8,Food for thought: How your belly controls your brain | Ruairi Robertson | TEDxFulbrightSantaMonica,"""Have you ever had a gut feeling or butterflies in your stomach? Has hunger ever changed your mood? Our bellies and brains are physically and biochemically connected in a number of ways, meaning the state of our intestines can alter the way our brains work and behave, giving a whole new meaning to 'Food for thought'. As a nutritionist, microbiologist and neuroscientist, Ruairi Robertson is passionate about the link between our bellies and brains. His research is examining how our intestines and the microbes within them can influence both physical and mental health, and most importantly how our diets influence this relationship. Ruairi has travelled the world researching food, and believes it is the key to global public health. Ruairi is a PhD student in University College Cork in Ireland and current Fulbright Scholar (2015/16) to Harvard University.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

fPxDjkqAE2I,15 FOODS THAT'LL NEVER MAKE YOU FAT,"What can you eat without getting fat? Everyone’s cherished dream is to eat anything at any time and still not gain weight. Is this possible?! Actually, there are foods you can eat without limitations even if you’re crazy about keeping your figure. Sounds too good to be true! These foods are rich in fiber while being low calorie, satiating you without the risk of gaining weight. Lucky you – today, we’ve compiled a list of such foods! And forget the myth that you’ll gain weight if you eat after 6pm. It’s completely wrong! In fact, if you want to stay slim, it’s best to have dinner 3-4 hours before bed. So if you go to bed at 11 p.m., you can calmly eat at 7 p.m. It won’t hurt your figure at all!TIMESTAMPS: Popcorn 0:36Celery 0:59Eggplant 1:16Oranges, grapefruits, and tangerines 1:39Melon and watermelon 2:07Algae 2:21Zucchini 2:37Cucumber 2:51Beetroot 3:08Eggs 3:21Pineapple 3:35Apples and plums 3:50Salad 4:03Berries: currant, cranberry, strawberry 4:10Cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower 4:27#weightloss #excessweight #perfectfitSUMMARY:- If you fry popcorn without butter and sugar (with a little salt, for instance), you can eat it without fear. This way, a portion (about a cup) only contains 31 kcal.- Celery stems are 95% water. They help you lose excess weight and detoxify your body thanks to their diuretic effect. A medium-sized stalk of celery contains only 6 calories!- A portion of eggplant grilled or baked without oil makes for 24 kcal, so you can enjoy this savory veggie without any limitations.- A large amount of fruit is not recommended if you want to lose weight, yet citrus fruits are an exception here. They’re rich in substances like fiber, flavonoids, and vitamin C.- Melon and watermelon are 95% water. With 60-70 kcal per slice, you can eat them day in and day out. These fruits help excrete excess liquid from your body and satiate you well.- Algae, like laminaria, are the best source of iodine. They help your thyroid function normally, keeping your hormones at normal levels and preventing you from gaining weight.- A portion of zucchini is about 42 kcal. It normalizes your salt-water ratio, improves your intestinal function, and can also be used to lower the energy output of main courses.- A cucumber is 95% water; therefore, this vegetable can quench your thirst easily. And the remaining 5% is a source of vitamins and minerals.- Beetroot is a source of nutrients, such as manganese. They help burn fat, drive your muscles, and regulate your blood sugar. An average portion is just 40 kcal!- You can eat eggs at any time of the day, even at night, without fear of gaining weight. Of course, boiled eggs are better than fried ones. One boiled egg contains about 80 kcal!- The bromelain contained within pineapples actively splits fats and helps metabolize proteins. A slice of pineapple is about 30 kcal.- One apple is only 50 kcal. It makes you feel satiated and regulates your digestion. Plums are rich in vitamin C and potassium, which maintain your heart and vessels.- Salad is a great source of folic acid, and you can eat it by the ton: one leaf of lettuce is 3 kcal!- Currants and cranberries are rich in vitamin C, and the former is also a diuretic, helping get rid of excess water.- A portion of diced cabbage is just 7 kcal. You shouldn’t, of course, only eat cabbage and cauliflower, as their nutrients rival with iodine, but you can easily include these foods a couple of times a week.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZzFor copyright matters please contact us at: welcome@brightside.me----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/",food

TeLiBBxIbaw,Foods You are NOT Allowed to Eat In the USA !,"Whether it’s rotten cheese consumed by maggots, or mysterious brownies that make you really sleepy, here are foods you’re not allowed to eat in the USSubscribe to American Eye http://goo.gl/GBphkv6. Mirabelle PlumDon’t get caught acting suspicious around the police if you got a few of these illegal plums stashed on you! These plums you see here are grown only in the Lorraine region of France and people from the US won’t get to taste them unless they travel to western europe. You’re probably thinking, “what’s the big deal”? They’re just plums for crying out loud not an endangered species or anything. It’s somewhat of a mystery why exactly they’re banned but the answer seems to come down to money. In order to protect the financial income of the eastern province in France, most countries have agreed not to sell them. It’s a little bit similar to how we have to have the differences between Champagne and Sparkling water. Whatever the reason exactly might be, you aren’t allowed to eat them, cuz we said so! 5. Unpasteurized MilkMost of the milk we drink and the cheese we eat must go through a process known as pasteurization first before we consume it. The process was introduced by Louis Pasteur in the 1860’s and This kills the bacteria and other microbes which would be harmful for consumption . not only that but this allows for it to be stored on the shelf longer. Although some states allow the sale for raw milk 17 states have banned it. Those who are in favor of non pasteurization claim that the milk loses many of its nutrients once it goes through the process.  But those who claim pasteurized milk is the way to go state that too many diseases are spread from just raw milk. In any case, it is probably best not to drink raw milk unless it’s from the mom to the offspring4. Lazy CakesThis cakes are banned in arkansas and strangely enough, they might actually make you feel lazy. The brownies are laced with melatonin and are known to cause severe drowsiness. Melatonin is often used as an over the counter sleep supplement and typically isn’t found in our food. Rumors went on full effect when people started saying that they put some type of synthetic cannabis substance in there but in any case they will make people sleepy. Maybe people who sell them don’t realize they’re not your average brownie, and you have to kind of read the fine print to find out. 3. Pig’s Blood CakeWho on Earth would eat something that sounds this horrifying? If you guessed the Taiwanese, good job! Pig’s blood cake has been banned in the US due to sanitary reasons and whatever other reason they find is fine by me. No need to guess what the secret ingredient is with this one. It’s basically like a street food delicacy that’s made with soy broth, sticky rice and oh yeah, pigs blood! The rice is then dipped in blood and deep fried. Other ingredients might be used to coat the deep fried pig blood on a stick but once you eat it, you have to live with yourself! Supporters of the treat claim there is no sanitary issues with the preparation process but it’s still banned here!2. Conch QueenThis beautiful shellfish becomes actually pretty tasty once you open it up and eat it. The conch queen is a banned food in the US to import mostly because overfishing threatens its existence. It’s actually more like a giant sea snail which has a very sturdy shell. The caribbean is the main exporter of conch meat to the us and demand for it quite high and the US is responsible for 80 percent of the consumption of this endangered creature.Purple Mangosteen One forbidden fruit that you probably shouldn’t eat or at least be aware of is the purple mangosteen. This is a highly sought after fruit which which a delicacy in thailand must be destroyed completely if it’s found in the US! The problem isn’t that it’s a rare fruit or anything but the goal isr to keep the asian fruit fly out, which is responsible for complete destruction of some crops. The tropical species has already wreaked havoc on the state of Florida and we don’t want this thing in our country! It’s been notorious for attacking over 400 different species of fruits and vegetables.",food
P2BVyHOdFUo,You Can't Reheat Some Foods Under Any Circumstances,"Is it safe to microwave your food? Let's imagine you went out to dinner last night. Chances are you brought home the leftovers and they’re sitting in your fridge right now. But before you break out the styrofoam carton, pop it in the microwave, and chow down, you should know that there are some foods that actually turn poisonous when reheated! No matter how tasty and healthy your freshly prepared meal is, it can lose its health benefits and even cause food poisoning if you reheat it in a microwave. Bright Side introduces to you a list of foods that you should eat as soon as they’re cooked.Other videos you might like:8 EVERYDAY HABITS THAT DAMAGE YOUR HEALTH https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wNAg...7 Food Combinations That Can Ruin Your Health https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRbhv...18 Harmful Foods We Keep Giving to Children https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf5Ak...TIMESTAMPS: Mushrooms 0:55Eggs 1:32Rice 3:01Breast milk or formula 3:57Chicken and processed meat 4:57Potatoes 6:21Celery, spinach, and beets 7:22#badforyourhealth #eatitfresh #eathealthyMusic by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ SUMMARY:- Whether they’re in a soup or stir-fry, reheating mushrooms in the microwave or on the stove is a big no-no. The change in composition can cause you to have an upset stomach, and they also lose their health benefits.- Similarly to mushrooms, eggs are packed with protein that changes once it’s reheated. This can wreak havoc on your digestive system. In fact, eggs can become toxic when exposed to a microwave’s high temperatures.- Even if the rice is cooked, boiling water won’t kill the bacteria. After the rice cools off to room temperature, its bacteria spores can multiply, and reheating it just keeps the bacteria alive. The longer it sat at room temperature, the more likely it is to contain harmful bacteria.- When it’s time to reheat the breast milk, you should never heat it in a microwave because the uneven distribution of heat can create hot spots in the milk, which can seriously burn the poor baby who drinks it.- Just like mushrooms, reheating chicken can change the food’s protein compounds and make you very sick. Unlike other meat (like beef), chicken contains a high amount of protein, which makes reheating it in the microwave a bad idea.-  If you place cooked potatoes directly into the fridge after cooking them, it’s probably safe to reheat them. However, if they sit out at room temperature for a while after they’re prepared, they’re more likely to develop a rare bacteria known as botulism. - While nitrites are dangerous for adults, they’re incredibly dangerous for infants from 0 to 6 months. If they do ingest food with nitrites, they are more likely to develop “blue baby syndrome,” which can be fatal.- Before you stick a leftover sandwich in the microwave, don’t forget to remove any toothpicks the restaurant may have stuck in there! Along with items with sharp tips, metal is a big no-no when it comes to microwave cooking.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuCPhotos: https://www.depositphotos.comEast News----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/",food

1MWvRF2izhs,PAUSE CHALLENGE w/ Rebecca Zamolo for 24 hours! Squishy Food vs. Real Food (Game Master spy Wins),"Rebecca does a fun 24 hour diy challenge overnight after we successfully defeat the Quadrant in a battle royale and get a secret message from the Game Master.▶ Last Game Master secret hidden riddle to solve: https://goo.gl/BJS4WW▶ New ZamFam Merch is here! https://rebeccazamolo.com Rebecca Zamolo spent 24 hours inside a dollhouse escape room in real life and helped the Game master defeat the Quadrant.  Matt and Rebecca then decided to do a fun pause challenge video recreating the best moments of other YouTubers like Morgz & twins Lucas and Marcus. Even though the RZ twin ended up escaping, the Game Master sent us a message letting us know we could do our fun videos again.  In today’s video, I decide to try the 24 hour pause challenge overnight eating real food vs squishy food. This is similar to the gummy food vs real food game I have done before, but with a diy twist and my husband Matt pausing me. For breakfast, we drive to a donut shop and I match each squishy with the real food so they match. While having lunch on our roof I chose the hotdog squishy and discuss where we think the RZ Twin might be hiding. We have no idea if she is still working for the quadrant. Finally, we go through a drive thru before 3am to order a burger and fries. Matt pauses me and tried to put caviar on my food before I eat. His reaction when I smash the ice cream cone into his face at the end is hilarious! Do you think the fun challenges will continue or is RZ twin still spying on us?

It’s one of the most fascinating cities in the world, and it’s a city that I’ve wanted to visit my entire life. Finally, along with my friend David (https://www.instagram.com/the.hungry....) and Rafram, we explored Jerusalem to discover the food treasures the city has to offer - and let me tell you, you’ll find some incredibly delicious food in Jerusalem! We started off the Jerusalem food tour by first walking around East Jerusalem and starting with the best plate of hummus I’ve ever had. We then toured around Old Jerusalem, and enjoyed some incredible Palestinian food kebabs cooked by an incredible man who cooked with serious love and passion. Another highlight in Jerusalem was the mutabak, a thin  pastry stuffed with cheese and baked.After eating our way through Old Jerusalem, we then headed into West Jerusalem and went to lunch at an Israeli Jewish restaurant serving a mix of amazing dishes. The food was home-cooked in style, and absolutely sensation. A few more snacks and sightseeing throughout the afternoon, and that brought us all the way to dinner where David had made reservations to eat at one of the hottest restaurants in Jerusalem, Machneyuda Restaurant. It was quite an experience, and an amazing meal and lively atmosphere to wrap up this ultimate Jerusalem food tour.Here’s all the food and places included in this Palestinian food and Israeli food tour of Jerusalem:Hummus AcramawiPrice - 20 ILS ($5.57) per plateAlmond juice - 3.90 ILS ($1.09)Al-shuala Grill RestaurantShawarma - 26 ILS ($7.26)Al Baghdadi KababPalestinian kebabsTotal price - 100 ILS ($27.89)Zalatimo SweetsMutabakPrice - 30 ILS ($8.37) eachPeaches - 10 for 1 kgPlums - 10 for 1 kgFruit - 10 ILS ($2.76) per kg.Mahane Yehuda MarketAzura RestaurantTotal price - 400 ILS ($111.55)Western Wall (Wailing Wall)Western Wall TunnelPrice - 35 ILS ($9.76) per personDome of the RockMount of OlivesMachneyuda RestaurantTotal price - 700 ILS ($195.21)It was a lot of food in a single day, but it was one of the greatest food and learning days that I’ve ever had in my life. The generosity of the people we connected with, paired with the food, was truly a memorable experience in Jerusalem.Thank you again to David (https://www.instagram.com/the.hungry....) and Rafram for showing me some of the best food in Jerusalem!-MUSIC in This Video:  Souls of Time, Arabian Feast - https://goo.gl/HwVjdoCAMERA GEAR used to make this video (these are affiliate links):GH5: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2mcEGauMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zTripod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkII would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyT-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/Thank you for watching!",food

wlLP3Etr1Ns,Discover nail manufacturing process - Nail production line,"- Discover nail manufacturing process- Nail production line In woodworking and construction, a nail is a pin-shaped object of metal (or wood, called a treenail or ""trunnel"") which is used as a fastener, as a peg to hang something, or sometimes as a decoration.[1] Generally nails have a sharp point on one end and a flattened head on the other, but headless nails are available. Nails are made in a great variety of forms for specialized purposes. The most common is a wire nail. Other types of nails include pins, tacks, brads, and spikes. Nails are typically driven into the workpiece by a hammer, a pneumatic nail gun, or a small explosive charge or primer. A nail holds materials together by friction in the axial direction and shear strength laterally. The point of the nail is also sometimes bent over or clinched after driving to prevent pulling out.",manufacturing

Clay which provides aluminium and silica.Cement is manufactured by two methods they are. Wet process. Dry process. Now let us discuss wet process and dry process detailed.WET PROCESS:In the wet process, first the clay is purified by washing in a wash mill.The lime stone is crushed into small particles and mixed with purified clay in proper proportions to get raw slurry.DRY PROCESS: In the dry process the raw materials are mixed in proper proportions.The mixture is dried, pulverized (Crushed into fine particles) and made uniform. The resulting powder is called ""raw material"".The raw slurry or raw meal, obtained by one of wet or dry process called charge. Charge is introduced into a rotary Kiln.The rotary kiln consists of a steel cylinder about 150meters long and 4meter diameter and rotates 30 to 60 turns per hour.At one end of the cylinder a screw conveyer is arranged which slowly allows the charge into the cylinder.The other end of the cylinder, a burneris arranged coal or burning oil is burnt at this end.The charge entering the cylinder slowly moves towards the hot end.At the burning end of the kiln, the temperature is around 1700 to 1900degrees centigrade, at this end some chemical reactions takes place between calcium oxide and aluminium silicates.Mixture of calcium silicates and calcium aluminates is formed.The resultant product consists of gray hard balls called clinker cement.Clinker cement is cooled, ground to fine powder and mixed with 2 to 3 percent of gypsum.",manufacturing

eF5LVBW1vl8,Manufacturing plywood boards: then and now,"Plywood is a simple material made by glueing together thin sheets of wood, known as veneers or plies. These basic elements have remained broadly the same throughout its history. The most significant breakthrough in its production came in the early 1800s with the development of steam-powered machines that could cut veneers cheaply. The most influential of these was the rotary veneer cutter.The cutter rotates a log against a wide, horizontal blade, causing it to ‘peel’ into a continuous sheet of wood. This enables the creation of longer, wider sheets of veneer than previously possible and with little waste. Using these machines meant that plywood could be manufactured quickly and inexpensively on a large scale.This film shows the stages in manufacturing plywood boards in the mid-20th century and today. The process remains essentially unchanged, although today many of the machines are much faster and computer controlled.

Spread over 50 acres, the plant is the bike maker's third manufacturing facility and will manufacture Royal Enfield motorcycles for India and international markets.Construction of the new facility started 15 months back and has been completed in record time. The new facility has been benchmarked to the highest level of quality and productivity. The manufacturing capacity in this facility will enable the company to meet its next level of growth.In the first phase, the state-of-the-art plant kicks off with an installed production capacity of 300,000 motorcycles. In FY2017-18, the combined production capacity from all the three plants is planned to be 8,25,000 units. In FY2016-17, Royal Enfield produced and sold 6,67,135 motorcycles, nearing its installed capacity. The company’s sales have grown at a compounded rate of over 55 percent over the past six years. According to Royal Enfield, its order book continues to be strong and there is a large unmet demand. In FY2017-18, it plans to invest Rs 800 crore, largely towards capacity expansion at Vallam Vadagal, new products and platforms, and setting up of technical centres in Leicester, UK and Chennai, India. This investment will be funded through internal accruals.Recently, Bajaj Auto formed an alliance with Triumph Motorcycles to enter the mid-sized motorcycle space. There are a number of other domestic OEMs also eyeing this segment. The capacity expansion is also part of Royal Enfield’s strategy to prepare itself to face competition.Royal Enfield begins production at new Chennai plantRoyal Enfield Manufacturing Process Plant - ChennaiRoyal Enfield Manufacturing Process Plant - ChennaiRoyal Enfield Manufacturing Process Plant - ChennaiRoyal Enfield Manufacturing Process Plant - ChennaiRoyal Enfield Manufacturing Process Plant - ChennaiRoyal Enfield Manufacturing Process Plant - ChennaiRoyal Enfield Manufacturing Process Plant - ChennaiRoyal Enfield Manufacturing Process Plant - Chennai-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-Please watch: ""Royal Enfield Full Service At HOME - PART 1"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7p6A...-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-",manufacturing

dRMF9lC0tXs,Additive Manufacturing - Laser Deposition Technology LDT:,"Additive Manufacturing - Laser Deposition Technology (LDT):------------------------------------------------------------------Laser Deposition Technology (LDT) is a process in which metal powder is injected into the focused beam of a high-power laser under tightly controlled atmospheric conditions. The focused laser beam melts the surface of the target material and generates a small molten pool of base material. Powder delivered into this same spot is absorbed into the melt pool, thus generating a deposit that may range from 0.125 to 1 mm thick and 1 to 4 mm wide. The resulting deposits may then be used to build or repair metal parts for a variety of different applications.There are three main areas where LDT can be used in manufacturing processes; it can be used in repair of worn components, especially in any type of mechanical equipment with moving parts. This process is known as Laser Repair Technology (LRT). Also, this technique can be used in the application of cladding materials, which known as Laser Cladding Technology (LCT). LCT is a process that repairs surfaces on parts by first machining down the worn surface and building it back up by depositing cladding material in thin layers to restore the worn surface. Finally, this technique can be used in performing near-net-shape freeform builds, which known as Laser Freeform Manufacturing Technology (LFMT). This technique starts with a CAD drawing of a part, from this electronic drawing, a tool path file is built. The laser deposition system then builds the part layer by layer. LFMT can build complex shapes, prototyping and manufacturing some parts in far less time than any other technique.Eng. Rami Khalil",manufacturing

kusAX4Th4N8,Manufacturing Consent: Thought Control in a Democratic Society - Noam Chomsky,"Walter Lippmann (23 September 1889 -- 14 December 1974) was an American public intellectual, writer, reporter, and political commentator famous for being among the first to introduce the concept of Cold War. More Chomsky: https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=U...Lippmann was twice awarded (1958 and 1962) a Pulitzer Prize for his syndicated newspaper column, ""Today and Tomorrow"".Edward Louis Bernays (November 22, 1891 -- March 9, 1995), was an Austrian-American pioneer in the field of public relations and propaganda, referred to in his obituary as ""the father of public relations."" He combined the ideas of Gustave Le Bon and Wilfred Trotter on crowd psychology with the psychoanalytical ideas of his uncle, Sigmund Freud.He felt this manipulation was necessary in society, which he regarded as irrational and dangerous as a result of the 'herd instinct' that Trotter had described. Adam Curtis's award-winning 2002 documentary for the BBC, The Century of the Self, pinpoints Bernays as the originator of modern public relations, and Bernays was named one of the 100 most influential Americans of the 20th century by Life magazine.Harold Dwight Lasswell (February 13, 1902 — December 18, 1978) was a leading American political scientist and communications theorist. He was a member of the Chicago school of sociology and was a professor at Yale University in law. He was a President of the American Political Science Association (APSA) and World Academy of Art and Science (WAAS). According to a biographical memorial written by Gabriel Almond at the time of Lasswell's death and published by the National Academies of Sciences in 1987, Lasswell ""ranked among the half dozen creative innovators in the social sciences in the twentieth century."" At the time, Almond asserted that ""few would question that he was the most original and productive political scientist of his time."" Areas of research in which Lasswell worked included the importance of personality, social structure, and culture in the explanation of political phenomena. He was noted to be ahead of his time in employing a variety of methodological approaches that later became standards across a variety of intellectual traditions including interviewing techniques, content analysis, para-experimental techniques, and statistical measurement.The Committee on Public Information, also known as the CPI or the Creel Committee, was an independent agency of the government of the United States created to influence U.S. public opinion regarding American participation in World War I. Over just 28 months, from April 13, 1917, to August 21, 1919, it used every medium available to create enthusiasm for the war effort and enlist public support against foreign attempts to undercut America's war aims.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committe...",manufacturing

We can divide the process into 4 stages: material & pigment preparation, injection mold set up, molding parameters adjustment, molding production run.After mold setting up to injection machine, we will start cleaning off the barrel. It is a time-consuming job sometimes. We will have to put clean material to the barrel so that the barrel to be free of the previous material in last injection molding thoroughly.When start adjusting the molding parameter, we will start some safer molding parameter. The process normally will start from about 50% of a full molded part, then 80%, then 95-98%, final adjusting external cosmetic and other specified tolerance if there is any special requirement.For production tool, we would suggest having the production window as large as possible. So that it will be more steady quality during molding production. The tool building lead time will be longer, while the cost will be higher.While for rapid tooling, and low-volume injection molding, the tooling structure would be simplified. Then molding parameters adjustment would be more difficult. And also, during low-volume production, the production situation would not be as steady, or efficiency as a production tool.In low-volume production, unit prices of adjusting molding parameters would be considered in rapid tooling, low volume production and a small quantity of on-demand manufacturing. While at high volume production, molding parameters adjustment normally is not considered into unit prices.Danke Mold specialized in medium-low volume injection molding, quick-turn injection molding.

TjqRJZswl-U,Exclusive tour of LG's OLED R&D and manufacturing facilites in South Korea,"Check out our CES 2019 coverage! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...LG brought Digital Trends along on an exclusive tour of several of its labs and factories halfway around the globe in Seoul, South Korea -- and we’re bringing you inside with us.Make no mistake: Much of what we saw was confidential information, of the “I could tell you but I’d have to kill you” sort. But we can share enough to give you a rare peek behind the curtain.The Paju complex is made up of eight enormous buildings each seemingly larger than an airport terminal that sit on 420 acres. A ninth, called P9, is currently under construction. When completed, it will be the world’s largest OLED manufacturing plant. More than 17,000 people work at Paju, many living in enormous residential complexes on site. We flew on the LG helicopter an hour south to the Gumi facility, where LG assembles OLED and LED televisions. It was especially big: Picture several warehouses fused together. It doesn’t require the clean-room garb we donned for phone assembly. Because technology changes so rapidly, assembly lines are designed to be modular. The Seocho Research & Development facility. It was born in 2009, and over 3000 people work there, giving birth to high-tech ideas from a glimmering pool of silicon and ambition. And as such, it’s one of the super secretive facilities that LG guards closely: Admission to Seocho meant forfeiting cell phones and laptops, signing non-disclosure forms, and so on. Indeed, we were only allowed to record a short video outside of the building.SUBSCRIBE FOR THE LATEST VIDEOShttp://bit.ly/DTYouTubeSubVISIT DIGITAL TRENDS http://www.digitaltrends.com/CHECK OUT OUR LATEST PODCASThttp://www.digitaltrends.com/podcasts/FOLLOW US!https://www.facebook.com/digitaltrendshttps://twitter.com/digitaltrendshttps://www.instagram.com/digitaltrendshttps://plus.google.com/+digitaltrend...",manufacturing

You traded in your gas-guzzling SUV for a Prius and your Keurig for a Coffee Maker -- and if enough of us do that, we’ll save the Earth, right? Well, we are dangerously close to collapsing our own ecosystem and we are running out of time.

zttC2x9nMEw,Audi Electric Motors Production,"2018 Audi Electric Motors Assembly. Subscribe. This video is Oddly Satisfying. #oddlysatisfying #production #factory #Audi #ElectricMotorAudi Hungaria starts series production of electric motors. Production of electric motors is a key milestone along the way to electric mobility.A new era is starting at Audi Hungaria. On Tuesday, series production of electric motors officially started in Győr. In the context of the symbolic act, the production plant was put into operation by Péter Szijjártó, Minister for Foreign Trade and Foreign Affairs, Peter Kössler, Board of Management Member for Production and Logistics at AUDI AG, and Achim Heinfling, Managing Director of AUDI HUNGARIA Zrt. The electric motors are produced on floor space of 8,500 square meters with an innovative production concept: modular assembly. The company has invested a double digit million amount to set up the motor production facility. Approximately 100 people are employed in this new area at present.For the production of electric motors, Audi Hungaria installed the innovative production equipment and islands within just one year. The departments for the development of electric motors and for production planning cooperated closely with the prototype manufacturing/ production technology center in Győr to develop the required expertise. The current production capacity is for approximately 400 electric axle motors each day and can be gradually increased. At present, about 100 people are employed in this new area, to be increased to more than 130 by the end of the year. Production is with one‑shift operation, but will soon change to three shifts.The electric motor from Győr offers numerous new features. With the stator – one of the core components of the motor – the aim is to insert as much of the thin enameled copper wire as possible into the casing: the tighter the winding, the more efficient the power delivery. A new winding and inserting center at Audi Hungaria makes it possible to wind the optimal amount of enameled copper wire particularly compactly and then insert it into the casing. The electric axle consists of other large components such as the power electronics, which are located in their own housing, the gearing and two flange shafts that transmit the power to the wheels. The employees produce two electric axle drive systems for each Audi e-tron, as both the front and rear axles are driven – in good quattro tradition.The production equipment, the robots and the bolting and measuring station are set out in fixed positions but are not linked together by a linear band. Instead, the employees produce the drive systems according to a modular method in production islands. Despite a predefined assembly sequence, the modular system allows branched paths and more free scope in the production process. Driverless vehicles, controlled by an intelligent IT system, transport the parts to the workstations.In parallel to the production facility, Audi Hungaria has installed three test benches for electric motors in the engine/motor development department, for testing and continuous load operation. The employees have undergone further training to become electrical experts in the production technology center for electric motors.Audi Hungaria produced 1,965,165 engines last year, making the company one of the world’s largest engine producers. At the plant in Győr, six different gasoline engines and three different diesel engines were produced in 2017 with power output ranging from 63 kilowatts (86 horsepower) to 470 kW (639 hp). Approximately 6,000 employees produce about 9,000 engines each day for 32 production plants of the Volkswagen Group.",manufacturing

It starts with designing a shirt, pattern making, sewing, cutting and then goes into large production manufacturing. More from Bella Canvas: http://bit.ly/2t9Guo6 When starting a clothing line it's important to know the process, and this video is a great way to learn what it takes to create a t-shirt from scratch. Sign up to the newsletter and receive free downloads to help grow your business + enter to win upcoming giveaways:  http://bit.ly/Apparel-Download The following steps can be applied to make any product, so feel free to jot down notes and reference this section for future use. Step 1: T-Shirt Design The first step to making a t-shirt involves the design sketch. Create a sketch that depicts the angles and details you'd like the final shirt to have. It doesn't have to be super fancy, as long as you can show what you need. Designing a shirt with the end goal in mind helps the pattern maker know what you are going for. Thanks you Torey Lewitz for joining us.Step 2: Pattern MakingOnce the designs are completed, you will consult with a pattern maker to bring your clothing line to life. The pattern maker will take your designs and create “patterns” which are the pieces that will be cut and sewn together. Step 3: Sample CuttingOnce the patterns are completed, they are printing on a plotter that creates the outline for the sample cutter. The person in charge of cutting the sample will follow the guides to ensure the pieces are cut to the right specifications. Castle Notches allow the person in charge of sewing to close the product up right. Step 4: Sewing The T-ShirtAfter the fabric is cut out, it is ready to be sewn. The cut pieces are now the shape of the patterns and multiple sewing machines are used to finish the design. The final outcome is hopefully what you envisioned. But more than likely it won’t be the final fit, so you will repeat the process until you are happy with the size, fit and shape of your apparel line. Step 5: Mass Production CuttingAs soon as the shirt or apparel design you created is approved, the patterns are finalized and sent into the production process. John Chacon Head Of Production walks us through his process. Step 6: Mass Production Sewing Once the pieces are all cut out, they are sent to the sewing factory. The factory is given the cut fabric and the head of production is in charge of making sure everyone knows what their role is. Step 7: Order Fulfillment/ Clothing Line DistributionThe last step in this video is the order fulfillment and distribution of the finished clothing. As a clothing business you also have to think about how you will provide quicker shipping, handle returns and manage employees. Randy Pinter Head of Warehouse Distribution drops the knowledge on what it takes to run this facility.

B8Pkp7OhwPg,"Lean Manufacturing: Cycle Time Analysis, Variance Tracking & Eliminating Work Stoppages","http://www.driveyoursuccess.com The following video is a summary of a project that was run for a small manufacturer were we analyzed their production throughput, performed cycle time analysis and review while also tracking the variances in those cycle times. We use three methods to calculate average in cycle time analysis for this and other projects. These three are the mean, the mode and the median.The video explains how to calculate manufacturing cycle time averages in these three aforementioned ways. The mean is the one we always associate as average. This simply involves taking all the cycle times in a given sample portion and dividing it by the number of operations or cycle times captured.The next method of the mode manufacturing cycle time which is simply the cycle time that appears most frequently during the sample portion. Ultimately, the mode is often the one where the work stoppages and downtime are not a factor. As such, it's often the best benchmark for cycle time analysis.Finally, the median involves re-configuring all the times from lowest to highest and using the following calculation to identify the average time: Median { ( N + 1 ) / 2 } where N is the number of operations. In this case, it's 10 +1 = 11 divided by 2 which is 5.5. Therefore, we isolate the cycle time in-between the 5th and 6th time. Finally, all of these cycle times are placed on a graph in order to identify the variances in cycle times and high and low points.

ZK9cJt3C_I8,What is Manufacturing Execution System (MES)?,"Let’s tune as our President and CEO Scott Whitlock explains how MES is all about flows within manufacturing – planning flows, execution flows and monitoring flows.Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) are known by many names: data collection solutions, shop floor execution systems, and manufacturing operations management (MOM).Manufacturing Execution Systems collect multiple plants’ production information, and integrate easily with equipment, controllers and enterprise business applications. Although MES solutions are used to operate as a self-contained system, they are increasingly being integrated with enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. The result is complete visibility, control and manufacturing optimization – from order placing, production inception, and process control to product output.------Flexware Innovation, Inc. began in 1996 with a passion for helping manufacturers harness the power of MES and realize the strategic benefits of improved yields, lower operating costs and overall leaner manufacturing. And it’s still a passion for our FlexDogs today, as we help manufacturers across the U.S. implement MES within their operations. It’s one of the things we love most. Well that, and IoT technology within the manufacturing arena, but that’s a blog for another day.------To learn more about Flexware Innovation and how they help manufacturer's with their MES systems, please visit http://www.flexwareinnovation.com/To download our eBook ""5 Risks of Sticking with a Legacy MES"", visit http://flexwareinnovation.com/ebook/",manufacturing

YkO52UqWyEs,How Political Power Uses Propaganda to Distract the Public: Noam Chomsky - Manufacturing Consent,"Necessary Illusions: Thought Control in Democratic Societies is a 1989 book by US academic Noam Chomsky concerning political power using propaganda to distort and distract from major issues to maintain confusion and complicity, preventing real democracy from becoming effective. The title of this book borrows a phrase from the writings of Reinhold Niebuhr.Nearly the entire first half of the book is based on Chomsky's five 1988 Massey Lectures on Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Radio from November 1988 and extends his and Edward S. Herman's propaganda model to a variety of new situations. The remaining appendices address criticisms of the work and provide additional detail.As a genre of political thought, parallels exist between Niebuhr's ""necessary illusions"" and the ""noble lies"" of Leo Strauss, ""public relations"" of Edward Bernays and ""myth making"" of Niccolò Machiavelli. Likewise, Chomsky's analyses in Necessary Illusions represent a refocus on the use of these patterns of power, which he implies to underscore the failure of populations - particularly in a representative democracy - to learn from history in this regard.Contents     Democracy and the Media     Containing the Enemy     The Bounds of the Expressible     Adjuncts of Government     The Utility of InterpretationsAppendix I     The Propaganda Model: Some Methodological Considerations     On Critical BalanceAppendix II     The Containment Doctrine     The Red ScareAppendix III     The Sanctity of BordersAppendix IV     The Craft of ""Historical Engineering""     The Obligation of Silence     The Summits     The Media and International Opinion     Demolishing the AccordsAppendix V     The US and Costa Rican Democracy     ""The Evil Scourge of Terrorism""     Hereos and Devils     The ""Peace Process"" in the Middle East     The Best Defense     La Prensa and its Colleagues     ""The Courage to Preserve Civil Liberties""     The Continuing StruggleSee also     John Taylor Gatto The Underground History of American Education     Adam Curtis Century of the Selfhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessar...",manufacturing

Pushing is a manufacturing method that emphasizes storing a lot of products in order to have them ready to push to customers at a moment's notice. This results in high carrying costs and potentially more unusable inventory as it passes its expiration date.Pulling is more efficient than pushing. It emphasizes JIT (Just In Time) shipping and only ordering parts and products when customer orders come in. This cuts down on carrying costs and leads to a more streamlined operation. It is slower than the push method, so there is a trade-off.Fishbowl's Whiteboard Wednesday videos break down important inventory management topics in a couple of minutes.

jAInt7hIZlU,The Making of a Steinway - A Steinway & Sons Factory Tour Narrated by John Steinway,"The making of a Steinway piano is a time-honored process involving the hands of many skilled craftspeople over the course of almost a full year. Steinway & Sons pianos are built in just two factories worldwide - one in Astoria, NY and one in Hamburg, Germany. Both factories have been building pianos for well over a century, and although Steinway has always been at the cutting edge in utilizing and perfecting the latest technology where it could make the piano better, we have found that certain things are simply better when done by skilled craftspeople than by a machine. For that reason, many parts of the process in building a Steinway have remained essentially unchanged for generations. So much so, that we were able to take decades-old audio from a narrated factory tour by the late John H. Steinway (great-grandson of Henry E. Steinway, who founded our great company in 1853) and use it as the narration for footage shot at the Steinway NY factory in 2011 by Ben Niles, producer of the documentary film ""Note by Note"" (http://www.notebynotethemovie.com).

Z61Uii5K2j8,Improve Operator Efficiency - Manufacturing,"Measuring and improving operator efficiency of machines and equipment on the shopfloor can have a dramatic effect on manufacturing productivity and output.PlantRun systems can be used to measure, track and analyse individual operator performance and compare the performance of machine operators against time/machine/product etc.. This allows you to identify under performing staff for re-training and to spread the best practices of your most efficient staff thereby improving operator efficiency.Improved Time ManagementOperators starting late, taking extra time during breaks, finishing early and taking longer to restart a machine than they should is a typical scenario in many manufacturing companies.Even if  this is only arriving at the machine 5 minutes late, starting up 5 minutes later, taking an extra 10 minutes over lunchtime and then finishing 10 minutes early it amounts to 30 minutes in an 8 hour shift equivalent to 6.25%. Without continuous monitoring in place this is often much longer. And this is per machine, if you have 20 machines you are losing 10 man hours per shift!Maybe you don't think your staff do this, but until you measure breaks accurately you don't really know. For one PlantRun user a ""ten minute"" break period was reduced from 23 minutes down to 13 minutes upon installation of the system!Increasing Operator ProductivityAn example of increased operator productivity comes from a wire fabrication company producing a wide range of goods including roll containers, stillages, pallet converters, dollies, picking trollies and garment rails.The company employ a core staff of around 100 staff but at peak production times this number can double with low skilled agency staff. The productivity of temporary staff is variable and with a relatively labour intensive production process maximising operator output is vital. All the fabrication machinery is monitored for machine utilization efficiency.Operators log on to the system at shift start up and the system monitors run time, stop time and reasons for stoppage. By analysing downtime stoppages problems such as extended operator breaks are identified and addressed.System reports make it easy to identify operators with poor productivity performance for training or replacement.  A typical reported improvement in operator productivity boosted output per shift from 80 to 94 units, an increase of 17.5%.Improved MotivationStaff motivation can be improved in two ways.Firstly, the data collected by the system can be used to keep staff informed of their performance against target production rates either using the keypad terminals or large shopfloor displays.  Goal setting and competition between work groups or cells can significantly improve motivation and output.Secondly, the awareness that production is being monitored and the understanding that computers can't lie often have a refreshing effect on staff behavioural patterns and bad practices that may have been formed over time. In some cases dramatic improvements in productivity have been recorded before systems have been fully installed, simply from improving operator efficiency.",manufacturing

BGjVbnU-TpA,"क्यूँ आये थे मुघल भारत में , जानिये असलीयत इतिहासकी  | History Of India","क्यूँ आयेथे मुघल भारत में , जानिये असलीयत इतिहासकी  | History Of IndiaThe Mughal Empire (also referred to as Baburid Empire, Baburid Dynasty) was founded by Zahiriddin Muhammad Babur, a Timurid prince and ruler from Turan or Turkistan, i.e. Central Asia (Uzbekistan). Babur was a direct descendant to the Turkic Emperor Timur on his father's side and also had links to Chagatai, the second son of the Mongol ruler Genghis Khan, on his mother’s side.Ousted from his ancestral domains in Turkistan by Sheybani Khan, the 14-year old Prince Babur turned to India to satisfy his ambitions. He established himself in Kabul and then pushed steadily southward into India from Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass. Babur's forces occupied much of northern India after his victory at Panipat in 1526. The preoccupation with wars and military campaigns, however, did not allow the new emperor to consolidate the gains he had made in India.The instability of the empire became evident under his son, Humayun, who was driven out of India and into Persia by rebels.Humayun's exile in Persia established diplomatic ties between the Safavid and Mughal Courts, and led to increasing West Asian cultural influence in the Mughal court. The restoration of Mughal rule began after Humayun’s triumphant return from Persia in 1555, but he died from a fatal accident shortly afterwards.Humayun's son, Akbar, succeeded to the throne under a regent, Bairam Khan, who helped consolidate the Mughal Empire in India.Through warfare and diplomacy, Akbar was able to extend the empire in all directions, and controlled almost the entire Indian subcontinent north of the Godavari river. He created a new class of nobility loyal to him from the military aristocracy of India's social groups, implemented a modern government and supported cultural developments. At the same time Akbar intensified trade with European trading companies. The Indian historian Abraham Eraly wrote that foreigners were often impressed by the fabulous wealth of the Mughal court, but the glittering court hid darker realities, namely that about a quarter of the empire's gross national product was owned by 655 families while the bulk of India's 120 million people lived in appalling poverty.After suffering what appears to have been an epileptic seizure in 1578 while hunting tigers, which he regarded as a religious experience, Akbar grew disenchanted with Islam, and came to embrace a syncretistic mixture of Hinduism and Islam.Akbar allowed free expression of religion and attempted to resolve socio-political and cultural differences in his empire by establishing a new religion, Din-i-Ilahi, with strong characteristics of a ruler cult. He left his successors an internally stable state, which was in the midst of its golden age, but before long signs of political weakness would emerge. Akbar's son, Jahangir, ruled the empire at its peak, but he was addicted to opium, neglected the affairs of the state, and came under the influence of rival court cliques. During the reign of Jahangir's son, Shah Jahan, the culture and splendour of the luxurious Mughal court reached its zenith as exemplified by the Taj Mahal.The maintenance of the court, at this time, began to cost more than the revenueSubscribe Us : https://goo.gl/mRFqpS",history
_jw9CoOLOrI,जम्मू कश्मीर का पूरा इतिहास शुरू से लेकर आज तक | History of Jammu Kashmir State in Hindi,"In this video, we will talk about Jammu and Kashmir, what is the ancient history of Kashmir, when whom were the rulers ruled over this kingdom?the ancient Jammu Kashmir:Caspian Sea and Kashmir came only after the name of Kashyap Rishi. From the Caspian Sea to Kashmir, the rule of the people of the family of Rishi Kashyap was spread. History of Kashyap Rishi is considered to be ancient, because ancient history of Jammu with the Harappan-carved remains from Akhnoor and the artwork of Maurya, Kushan and Gupta period reveals Kashmir. Kashyap Rishi was the first King of Kashmir and he made Kashmir the state of his dreams.According to the legend of Rajatarangini and Sapphire Purana, the Valley of Kashmir used to be a very big lake. According to geographers, the lake water flows out of the mountains, and thus there is a place to live in Kashmir. And in Rajatarangini texts today, authentic documents of ancient dynasties and kings of Kashmir 3200 years ago.After that in the third century BC, the great emperor Asoka had propagated Buddhism in Kashmir. Later Kanishka had the right to be here. At the beginning of the 6th century, the Huron had got the right on Kashmir. And in the 530 the Kashmir Valley was an independent state. After this the rulers of the Ujjain empire had the right to it. And there was a time when Ujjain used to be the capital of a united India.after the fall of the Vikramaditya dynasty, local rulers began to rule over Kashmir. There developed a mixed form of Hindu and Buddhist cultures. In the sixth century in Kashmir, the Shaiva philosophy developed in its kind, the first and the main name of the Shaiv ​​kings, is of Mihirakul, which belonged to the Hunan dynasty.#kashmir #J&K #JammuKashmirAfter the Han Dynasty, Gonanda II and Karakota Nag Dynasty ruled, whose King Lalithaditya Oppipid was included in the greatest kings of Kashmir. Lalitaditya among the Hindu kings of Kashmir, which became the most famous king between 697 and 738, because at that time the Kashmir state spread to east to Bengal, Konkan in the south, Turkestan in the north-west and Tibet in the north-east.After that in 855, the incarnation of Utl dynasty came to power, whose rule was the period of happiness and prosperity of Kashmir. Temples were built on a large scale during his 28 years of rule. At the same time, a long tradition of literary and Sanskrit teachers started in Kashmir, in which Bhim Bhatt, Damodar Gupt in the seventh century, Kshir Swami, Ratnakar, Vallabh Dev in the 8th century, from the Mamt, Kshayendra, Somadeva in the ninth century to the tenth century There is a long tradition of poets and commentators of Sanskrit scholars such as Milne, Jayadrath and Kalvana of the 11th century. But after the death of Avantivarman, the period of decline of Hindu kings started.Kashmiri Pandit Birbal Dhar sought help from Sikh King Ranjit Singh. He left thirty thousand army with his most capable warlords, including Hari Singh Nalva, under the leadership of his successor Khadak Singh. And Afzani Azim Khan, the brother of Jabbar Khan, left Kashmir and left for Kabul, thus, on 15th June 1819, the Sikh rule was established in Kashmir. Maharaj Ranjit Singh joined Jammu in Punjab and later he went to Gulab Singh handed over. But in the year 1839, with the death of Raja Ranjeet Singh, the Sikh empire of Lahore began to collapse and it was an opportunity for the British to control the border of Afghanistan.In ancient times Ladakh was the main center for many important trade routes. Ladakh was a big business center in Central Asia. A branch of Silk Route went through Ladakh. Hundreds of camels, horses, mule, silk and carpet were brought along with the activities of other countries, whereas colors, spices were sold from India. People from Tibet used to come to Leh by bringing wool, pashmina etc. on yak. The finest shawls were made here by bringing it to Kashmir.",history

DM8U9h6QSCI,Top 10 Famous and DEADLY SWORDS (And Their History),"The first sword appeared during the Bronze Age.  It was made of copper and was uncovered at the Harappan sites in present-day Pakistan.  By the Middle Ages iron and steel swords were being mass produced and used in battle.  Soldiers were trained in swordsmanship and prepared for combat.  It was before the era of guns and high powered artillery and face to face fighting was the norm.  During this time in history, all of the royal generals, kings, and emperors owned personal swords.  These weapons were manufactured by the greatest sword makers of the time.  Many historical manuscripts document events surrounding significant swords.  This article will be examining ten world famous swords that still survive today.

iloQeu-Yg7U,The Biggest Lies Told in History,"From legends about George Washington to historical monuments, here are the Biggest Lies told in History.  Subscribe to American Eye http://goo.gl/GBphkv10. Columbus Discovered America9. Paul Revere8. 13 Colonies7. Washington Cherry Tree6. The Crossing of the Delaware5. Van Gogh Cut off EarWhile in school, learning about famous artists, we all know that Van Gogh was simply a mad man who sliced off his ear and mailed it to his lover, right? Who would really inflict that much physical pain on themselves over an ex? After looking through quite a few letters and it seems more than likely that him and a friend of his got into a scuffle involving too much French wine and a sword. Which normally don’t mix too well. Van Gogh was certainly no snitch and didn’t want to report the incident that could potentially put his best friend in prison. 4. Sphinx NoseHow did the Sphinx lose it’s nose? Did it get a bad Rhinoplasty?  Or was While Napoleon was invading Egypt, he used the nose as a target practice for his cannons. This is another absurd historical legend that many still might believe. The nose was gone centuries before Napoleon was even born. Napoleon was fascinated with Egyptology and sought to preserve egypt’s antiquities. The limestone used to construct the sphinx eroded fairly quickly after a few thousand years had gone by. But Egypt is a Muslim country where worshipping idols is not permitted and it’s still a wonder how this monument is still here. Historical accounts from the 1400’s say that a religious islamist leader, Muhammad Sa’im al Dahr, destroyed the nose when he saw people worshipping the sphinx as an idol. 3. Vikings Horned HelmetsArchaeologists have a better chance of finding a unicorn than finding a horned viking helmet. Even the football team the Vikings, have horns on their helmet. This is just a modern day myth and an artist's portrayal of how the vikings actually looks while in battle. Thiss portrayal began in the 1800’s when scandinavians artists such as Malmstrom and Mary McGregor included this style of helmet, like we see in this illustration of Leif Ericsson discovering Vineland. Horned helmets did exist but these were over a couple thousand of years ago during the bronze age and used for ritualistic religious ceremonies2. StonehengeOne of the biggest ancient mysteries in the world is certainly stonehenge and they’ve been standing in that formation for 5000 years. Oh no don’t tell me this is a lie too. Could this all be some kind of cruel hoax? Historical records of the monument date back to about 1200 AD but it’s highly doubtful that they’ve been in the same position we see them today.  A curator from Cambridge University quoted,”Nearly all the stones we see today have been moved in some way and are standing in concrete.” This image we see here shows stonehenge in 1877 with stones leaning on eachother. Many monuments around the world must be restored at some point. This photo here shows some type of restoration project going on in 1898 with two men on top of a block that looks like it’s being placed there with a crane.  This photo shows the crane picking up the block and you can clearly tell this is a massive restoration project. Take a look at the photos and let us know what you believe. 1. First ThanksgivingSorry Guys, American eye has to ruin thanksgiving for you too. And there’s absolutely no truth to this one besides the feast itself and what we celebrate couldn’t be anything further from the truth! As a kid you might have believed your teacher saying that thanksgiving was a friendly celebration between Indians and Pilgrims who came together and feasted on Turkey legs and corn, sharing farming secrets. Thanksgiving was basically a celebration after a vengeful retaliation on native americans and it was celebrated around the same time each year. We won’t get into all the details but if you know how history tended to go between European settlers and Native Americans, you can probably take a good guess. Anyways, don’t let it keep you from enjoying some stuffing and turkey, which the pilgrims never ate",history

New technology scouring the vast depths are discovering the ruins of these lost lands. To the disbelief of established scientific communities, the evidence gathered correlates to surviving tales of an antediluvian world predating the establishment of Göbekli Tepe.

okcfKaC87r4,"American History Textbooks' Lies: Everything Your Teacher Got Wrong - Myths, Education (1995)","Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong is a 1995 book by sociologist James W. Loewen. More about the book: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/074...It critically examines twelve American history textbooks and concludes that textbook authors propagate factually false, Eurocentric, and mythologized views of history. In addition to critiquing the dominant historical themes presented in textbooks, Loewen presents a number of his own historical themes that he says are ignored by traditional history textbooks. A newly revised and updated hardcover edition was released on April 1, 2008. The New Press lists Lies My Teacher Told Me as its top all-time bestseller.In Lies My Teacher Told Me, Loewen criticizes modern American history textbooks for containing incorrect information about people and events such as Christopher Columbus, the lies and inaccuracies in the history books regarding the dealings between the Europeans and the Native Americans, and their often deceptive and inaccurate teachings told about America's commerce in slavery. He further criticizes the texts for a tendency to avoid controversy and for their ""bland"" and simplistic style. He proposes that when American history textbooks elevate American historical figures to the status of heroes, they unintentionally give students the impression that these figures are superhumans who live in the irretrievable past.

Belisarius wrote a furious letter to Justinian explaining what happened, and the emperor immediately recalled Narses and reaffirmed Belisarius's leadership. His army tore through the Ostrogothic territory and soon laid siege to Ravenna, which they brought to the brink of surrender. But the Ostrogothic King Vitiges had written to the Persian Empire urging them to take advantage of Rome's distraction. Sure enough, Justinian found himself faced with a Persian army in the East, and he sent orders to Belisarius to leave Ravenna and return to defend Constantinople. Belisarius hated seeing his victory snatched from him, however, and almost refused to do it. Hearing of his displeasure, the Ostrogoths reached out to him and offered to make him their new king - no surrender necessary. Belisarius accepted their proposal, then immediately turned on them and declared the city for Justinian. Still, his greed cost the empire time. Justinian was furious that Belisarius had disobeyed his orders to return and wasted precious months solidifying control over the Ostrogoths while Persia threatened to overrun the heart of the empire. He could no longer trust his most valued general.____________♫ Get the intro music here!http://bit.ly/1EQA5N7   *Music by Demetori: http://bit.ly/1AaJG4H♫ Get the outro music here!http://bit.ly/23isQfx   *Music by Sean and Dean Kiner: http://bit.ly/1LBy9zh",history

December 10th, 1968. It was pouring rain.The bank manager of the Nihon Trust bank was on edge. Someone had threatened his life and those around him over the past few months. Just four days prior, a letter (one of recent many) was sent to his personal residence demanding 300 million yen or his house would be blown up with dynamite. The letter was made up of characters cut out and pasted from movie magazines. Police were notified; and indeed they kept a close eye on the bank and his home; though, this did not ease the mind of the bank manager who shared his concerns with his branch employees. Now of course, this is Japan, and work is work; the show must go on. With this in mind, the bank manager went on with his duties, sending four of his employees to the nearby Toshiba factory to make a scheduled drop. So off they went, taking the company car, but not long after leaving the bank, the four heard police sirens approaching. (At that very moment they happened to be next to a prison of all places). A police officer screeched to a halt in front of the car, and frantically got off his motorcycle to warn them. ...

v5vw9vSTMBY,England's Forgotten Queen: Lady Jane Grey Imprisoned | History Documentary | Reel Truth History,"12th July 1553 was Lady Jane Grey's third day as Queen of England but Mary Tudor was already intending to do everything in her power to seize the crown. Historian Helen Castor explores how Mary's allegiance grew in size and also how Lady Jane started to lose the loyalty of the Privy Council, which led to her becoming a prisoner in the Tower of London.In 1553 Tudor England, Wales and Ireland is taken to the brink of a bloody civil war when the dying King Edward VI, son of Henry VIII, leaves the throne, not to his elder sister, Mary, but to his cousin, the Lady Jane Grey.This is a story of intrigue, conspiracy, political manoeuvring and a capital city preparing to be attacked. It is also the story of a young woman, ferociously manipulated by powerful men in the palace, who ends up losing her life as a result.The life of Lady Jane Grey is a tragic narrative. From the moment Edward VI draws Jane into the line of succession, her terrible fate, on the block in the Tower of London, is sealed.Helen Castor is a historian and a medievalist who has studied the She Wolves, those women who held power in various ways throughout the medieval period. Now she sets out to take a close look at the first woman to sit on the English throne, not as consort, but as a reigning Queen. But Helen discovers far more than a story about a Tudor Queen. The story of Jane Grey is surrounded by myth, confusion and propaganda. Images turn out not to be Jane, well known stories turn out to be fake and many of the books disagree on the details. Helen asks why the first woman to be proclaimed Queen of England has attracted so much bending of the truth.Helen undertakes some Tudor detective work and turns back to the primary sources in an attempt to separate the truth from the fiction. She builds the real story of Jane Grey and those dark figures that surrounded her, tracing her world, and the nine days she spent on the throne.To be the first to watch more full length documentaries, subscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb7x...Welcome to ReelTruth.History the home of gripping and powerful documentaries.

ebNO_1fnR0g,Top 10 Most Famous Lesbians in History,"Top 10 Most Famous Lesbians and Feminists in HistoryLesbian relationship isn’t something that surprises people anymore. If couples have to hide even in 2017, what must it have been like a few years ago, when the LGBT community didn't understand their sexuality themselves? The LGBT community owes a lot to the men and women who came before them, knew how society felt about them, and yet, chose to love a member of the same sex openly.10. Josephine BakerJosephine Baker (1906 – 1975) American-born French dancer, singer, and actor, was known by many monikers, such as the “Black Pearl,” “Bronze Venus,” and “Creole Goddess.” She was the first black woman to star in a major film, Zouzou. She married four times, and her adopted son Jean-Claude Baker describes his mother as a bisexual, and recalled his mother as having many “lady lovers.”9. Frida KahloFrida Kahlo de Rivera (1907 – 1954), was a Mexican painter known for her self-portraits. Much has been written about Kahlo, with her works being celerated by feminists for its depiction of the female experience and form. 8. Amrita Sher-GillAmrita Sher-Gil (1913 –1941) was an eminent Indian painter, sometimes known as India's Frida Kahlo. Her affairs with men and women were quite well known, with her using some of them as models for her work. In fact, her work Two Women is considered to be a painting of herself with her lover Marie Louise.7. Billie Jean KingBillie Jean King (born November 22, 1943) is an American former World No. 1 professional tennis player. She was the first prominent female athlete to reveal her sexuality, when details of her affair with her secretary, Marilyn Barnett, was made public.6. Virginia WoolfAdeline Virginia Woolf (1882 – 1941) was an English writer and one of the foremost modernists of the twentieth century. Woolf had a passionate relationship with Vita Sackville-West. This relationship inspired one of Woolf's most famous novels, Orlando , featuring the life of a poet who changes sex from man to woman over centuries, meeting the key figures of English literary history.5. Audre LordeAudre Lorde (1934 – 1992) was a black writer, feminist, womanist, and civil rights activist. She described herself as a “black, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet,” and was known for her activist work with Afro-German women in the 1980s.4. Barbara GittingsBarbara Gittings (1932 – 2007) was a prominent American activist for gay equality. Gittings served as the President of the New York chapter of the Daughters of Bilitis, picketed the White House in the 1960s to let the world know how easily homosexuals could be fired simply on the basis of their sexual orientation.3. Jane AddamsJane Addams known as the ""mother"" of Social Work (1860 – 1935) was a pioneer American settlement activist/reformer, social worker, sociologist, author, and leader in women's suffrage and world peace. She co-founded Hull House in 1889 with her first romantic partner Ellen Gates Starr. Addams was later in a relationship with Mary Rozet Smith, who was financially sound, and supported Addams's work at Hull House. Addams won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931.2. Queen Christina of SwedenChristina (1626 – 1689) reigned as Queen of Sweden from 1632 to 1654. Queen Christina rejected the role of a woman, which was simply to provide an heir, by announcing that she did not intend to marry. Modern biographers generally consider her to have been a lesbian, with many affairs with women noted during her life. Sources have found passionate letters to Ebba Sparre, and she was supposed to have had relationships with Gabrielle de Rochechouart de Mortemart, Rachel, a niece of Diego Teixeira and the singer Angelina Giorgino.1. SapphoSappho (c. 630 – c. 570 BC) was an archaic Greek poet from the island of Lesbos. The word “lesbian” is literally derived from the Greek island of Lesbos, where Sappho was born. Sappho's poetry was lyric poetry, and she is best known for her poems about love. Her poems spoke of the infatuations and love, both requited and unrequited, she felt for other women.Music: Greko Sketch by Kevin MacLeod from YouTube Audio LibraryOur Facebook Page http://fb.me/BestTop10Videos",history

Sqb44HTCOGw,Haji Ali Dargah Mumbai Miracle Story and History in hindi हाजी अली दरगाह का हिला देने वाला रहस्य,"The Haji Ali Dargah is a mosque and dargah (tomb) located on an islet off the coast of Worli in the southern part of Mumbai. Near the heart of the city proper, the dargah is one of the most recognisable landmarks of Mumbai.An exquisite example of Indo-Islamic Architecture, associated with legends about doomed lovers, the dargah contains the tomb of Sayed Peer Haji Ali Shah Bukhari.The Haji Ali Dargah was constructed in 1431 in memory of a wealthy Muslim merchant, Sayyed Peer Haji Ali Shah Bukhari, who gave up all his worldly possessions before making a pilgrimage to Mecca. Hailing from Bukhara, in present-day Uzbekistan, Bukhari travelled around the world in the early to mid 15th century, and eventually settled in present-day Mumbai.According to legends surrounding his life, once the saint saw a poor woman crying on the road, holding an empty vessel. He asked her what the problem was, she sobbed that her husband would thrash her as she stumbled and accidentally spilled the oil she was carrying. He asked her to take him to the spot where she spilt the oil. There, he jabbed a finger into the soil and the oil gushed out. The overjoyed woman filled up the vessel and went home.Later, Pir Haji Ali Shah Bukhari had a recurring and disturbing dream that he had injured Earth by his act. Full of remorse and grief from that day he became very serious and was not keeping well. Then with the permission of his mother he traveled to India with his brother and finally reached the shore of Mumbai – near Worli or at some place opposite the present tomb. His brother went back to their native place. Pir Haji Ali Shah Bukhari sent a letter with him to their mother informing her that he was keeping good health and that he had decided to reside at that place permanently for the spread of Islam and that she should forgive him.Till his death he kept spreading knowledge about Islam to the people and his devotees would regularly visit him. Before his death he advised his followers that they should not bury him at any proper place or graveyard and should drop his shroud ('kafan') in the ocean such that it should be buried by the people where it is found.His wish was obeyed by his followers. That is why the Dargah Sharief is built at the very site where his shroud came to rest in the middle of the sea where it perched on a small mound of rocks rising above the sea.

This new South Sea Company will have a monopoly on trade in the rich new lands of South America, but all the ports there are controlled by Spain, with whom Britain is at war. So Blunt pushes the country into a premature and unfavorable peace with Spain, enlisting famous authors to write his propaganda and convincing Queen Anne herself to tip the balance of Parliament in his favor. After the queen dies and the government changes hands, Blunt kicks Harley and his Tory leaders out of the company. He manages to bring King George I himself on board as a ceremonial leader, linking the success of the South Sea Company with the reputation of the monarchy. But while his maneuvering inflates the value of his company's stock, it's never produced anything close to the amount of money he's convinced people to invest in it.___________Get the intro music here!http://bit.ly/1EQA5N7   *Music by Demetori: http://bit.ly/1AaJG4HListen to the outro music here!http://bit.ly/1ERCS9G__________James Recommends - City Building Games Across the AgesAnno Series (Dawn of Discovery): http://bit.ly/18mJxPgExtra Credits - How High Costs Drive Players Away from F2P GamesFree to Play is Currently Broken: http://bit.ly/1AobnQV",history

BjkU_JR4Cno,England's Forgotten Queen: Lady Jane Grey's Execution | History Documentary | Reel Truth History,"Eight days into her reign as Queen of England, Lady Jane Grey took personal charge of the keys to the Tower of London and even locked her own supporters inside with her. The end was approaching but before her execution, she wrote multiple messages in her prayer book. Historian Helen Castor explores these notes and learns that Lady Jane was actually unflinching and composed until the day she died.In 1553 Tudor England, Wales and Ireland is taken to the brink of a bloody civil war when the dying King Edward VI, son of Henry VIII, leaves the throne, not to his elder sister, Mary, but to his cousin, the Lady Jane Grey.This is a story of intrigue, conspiracy, political manoeuvring and a capital city preparing to be attacked. It is also the story of a young woman, ferociously manipulated by powerful men in the palace, who ends up losing her life as a result.The life of Lady Jane Grey is a tragic narrative. From the moment Edward VI draws Jane into the line of succession, her terrible fate, on the block in the Tower of London, is sealed.Helen Castor is a historian and a medievalist who has studied the She Wolves, those women who held power in various ways throughout the medieval period. Now she sets out to take a close look at the first woman to sit on the English throne, not as consort, but as a reigning Queen. But Helen discovers far more than a story about a Tudor Queen. The story of Jane Grey is surrounded by myth, confusion and propaganda. Images turn out not to be Jane, well known stories turn out to be fake and many of the books disagree on the details. Helen asks why the first woman to be proclaimed Queen of England has attracted so much bending of the truth.Helen undertakes some Tudor detective work and turns back to the primary sources in an attempt to separate the truth from the fiction. She builds the real story of Jane Grey and those dark figures that surrounded her, tracing her world, and the nine days she spent on the throne.To be the first to watch more full length documentaries, subscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb7x...Welcome to ReelTruth.History the home of gripping and powerful documentaries.

B9YtgV7R4qs,History Channel - Civilization Lost - Full History Documentary,"Around the world, archaeologists are uncovering artifacts that suggest the existence of previously unknown ancient civilizations, much like the mythical city of Atlantis. There is a growing belief among certain scientists and archaeologists that tens of thousands of years ago, before the rise of today's man, sophisticated human societies populated large cities that possibly featured mechanized transportation, electricity, and advanced weapons systems. Proponents of this theory believe that these civilizations were wiped off the planet and that the evidence now lies buried miles beneath the Earth's surface. This two-hour special will investigate these beliefs and uncover the truth about people who lived before the beginning of recorded time.New full length HD documentaries are being posted every single day!

6pxxS07PZn0,In Search Of History - Charles Ponzi & His Scheme (History Channel Documentary),"This episode was converted from an old VHS tape that had considerable wear and tear, resulting in poor audio quality. Unfortunately it's the only copy I've been able to obtain so far.__________________________Narrated by David AckroydCharles Ponzi became known in the early 1920s as a swindler in North America for his money-making scheme. He promised clients a 50% profit within 45 days, or 100% profit within 90 days, by buying discounted postal reply coupons in other countries and redeeming them at face value in the United States as a form of arbitrage. In reality, Ponzi was paying earlier investors using the investments of later investors. His scheme ran for over a year before it collapsed, costing his ""investors"" $20 million.While this type of fraudulent investment scheme was not originally invented by Ponzi, it became so identified with him that it now is referred to as a Ponzi scheme.____________",history

Dfl4ZaiucpQ,The Anunnaki Creation Story: The Biggest Secret in Human History - Nibiru is Coming,"445 000 years ago, “creator gods” – as they call it – came to Earth. They were called the Anunnaki, which means “Those Who from Heaven to Earth Came”.  These beings inhabited a distant orbiting planet called Nibiru, which only entered our solar system every 3,600 years.  They describe Nibiru as many times the diameter of Earth, and abundant with iron oxide, making its rivers and lakes appear red. A side note about Nibiru:  according to the Sumerian tablets, Nibiru’s atmosphere began to deteriorate and became a hostile place for life, and in order to restore it, the Annunaki needed one important element for their atmosphere:  gold.Music: Kevin Macleod - Rites (Royalty Free)Cowritten and Narrated by Elisabeth Firestone: info@BestNarrator.comScenes from the following productions were used under Fair Use for educational purposes:History Channel's Ancient Aliens PBS NOVA's Secrets of Noah's Ark 2015 Ancient Sumerian History and Anunnaki Culture - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8sLX...

The biopic stars Rachel Weisz as Hypatia, a female mathematician, philosopher and astronomer in late 4th-century Roman Egypt, who investigates the flaws of the geocentric Ptolemaic system and the heliocentric model that challenges it. Surrounded by religious turmoil and social unrest, Hypatia struggles to save the knowledge of classical antiquity from destruction. Max Minghella co-stars as Davus, Hypatia's father's slave, and Oscar Isaac as Hypatia's student, and later prefect of Alexandria, Orestes.The story uses historical fiction to highlight the relationship between religion and science amidst the decline of Greco-Roman polytheism and the Christianization of the Roman Empire. The title of the film takes its name from the agora, a gathering place in ancient Greece, similar to the Roman forum. The film was produced by Fernando Bovaira and shot on the island of Malta from March to June 2008. Justin Pollard, co-author of The Rise and Fall of Alexandria (2007), was the historical adviser for the film.Agora was screened out of competition at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival in May, and opened in Spain on October 9, 2009 becoming the highest grossing film of the year for that country. Although the film had difficulty finding distribution, it was released country by country throughout late 2009 and early 2010. The film received a 53% overall approval rating from Rotten Tomatoes and seven Goya Awards in Spain, including Best Original Screenplay. It was awarded the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Feature Film Prize at the Hamptons International Film Festival.",history

k2ITQ08IqTs,Jewish History - Evidence Of Ancient Israel - Full Documentary,"Documentary on the history of Judaism, the Bible (Torah/Tanakh) and the Jewish people of Israel. Using the latest archaeological evidence from the stables of Ramses ll to little-known ancient Egyptian texts, Egyptologist and Bible Archaeologist show that Israel did in fact exist and had a presence in ancient Egypt. ""The Bible's Buried Secrets"" is the title of a NOVA program that stirred controversy even before its first airing on PBS, on November 18, 2008. According to the program's official website: ""The film presents the latest archeological scholarship from the Holy Land to explore the beginnings of modern religion and the origins of the Hebrew Bible, also known as the Old Testament. This archeological detective story tackles some of the biggest questions in biblical studies: Where did the ancient Israelites come from? Who wrote the Bible, when, and why? How did the worship of one God—the foundation of modern Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—emerge?”",history

Gibson portrays William Wallace, a 13th-century Scottish warrior who led the Scots in the First War of Scottish Independence against King Edward I of England. The story is based on Blind Harry's epic poem The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace and was adapted for the screen by Randall Wallace.The film was nominated for ten Academy Awards at the 68th Academy Awards and won five: Best Picture, Best Makeup, Best Cinematography, Best Sound Editing, and Best Director.Randall Wallace, who wrote the screenplay, has acknowledged Blind Harry's 15th century epic poem The Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace, Knight of Elderslie as a major inspiration for the film.[26] In defending his script, Randall Wallace has said, ""Is Blind Harry true? I don't know. I know that it spoke to my heart and that's what matters to me, that it spoke to my heart.""[26] Blind Harry's poem is now not regarded as historically accurate, and although some incidents in the film which are not historically accurate are taken from Blind Harry (e.g. the hanging of Scottish nobles at the start), [27] there are large parts which are based neither on history nor Blind Harry (e.g. Wallace's affair with Princess Isabelle).Elizabeth Ewan describes Braveheart as a film which ""almost totally sacrifices historical accuracy for epic adventure"".[28] The ""brave heart"" refers in Scottish history to that of Robert the Bruce, and an attribution by William Edmondstoune Aytoun, in his poem Heart of Bruce, to Sir James the Good Douglas: ""Pass thee first, thou dauntless heart, As thou wert wont of yore!"", prior to Douglas' demise at the Battle of Teba in Andalusia.[29] It has been described as one of the most historically inaccurate modern films.[30]Sharon Krossa notes that the film contains numerous historical errors, beginning with the wearing of belted plaid by Wallace and his men. In that period ""no Scots ... wore belted plaids (let alone kilts of any kind)."" Moreover, when Highlanders finally did begin wearing the belted plaid, it was not ""in the rather bizarre style depicted in the film"". She compares the inaccuracy to ""a film about Colonial America showing the colonial men wearing 20th century business suits, but with the jackets worn back-to-front instead of the right way around.""[31] ""The events aren't accurate, the dates aren't accurate, the characters aren't accurate, the names aren't accurate, the clothes aren't accurate—in short, just about nothing is accurate.""[32] The belted plaid (feileadh mór léine) was not introduced until the 16th century.[33] Peter Traquair has referred to Wallace's ""farcical representation as a wild and hairy highlander painted with woad (1,000 years too late) running amok in a tartan kilt (500 years too early)."" [34]In 2009, the film was second on a list of ""most historically inaccurate movies"" in The Times.[30] In the humorous non-fictional historiography An Utterly Impartial History of Britain (2007), author John O'Farrell notes that Braveheart could not have been more historically inaccurate, even if a ""Plasticine dog"" had been inserted in the film and the title changed to William Wallace and Gromit.",history

History has identified the period following the fall of the Roman Empire with a descent into barbarism – a terrible time when civilisation stopped. Waldemar Januszczak disagrees. In this landmark 4-part series Waldemar argues that the Dark Ages were a time of great artistic achievement, with new ideas and religions provoking new artistic adventures. He embarks on a fascinating trip across Europe, Africa and Asia, visits the world’s most famous collections and discovers hidden artistic gems, all to prove that the Dark Ages were actually an ‘Age of Light'.

5A_o-nU5s2U,Haitian Revolutions: Crash Course World History #30,"Ideas like liberty, freedom, and self-determination were hot stuff in the late 18th century, as evidenced by our recent revolutionary videos. Although freedom was breaking out all over, many of the societies that were touting these ideas relied on slave labor. Few places in the world relied so heavily on slave labor as Saint-Domingue, France's most profitable colony. Slaves made up nearly 90% of Saint-Domingue's population, and in 1789 they couldn't help but hear about the revolution underway in France. All the talk of liberty, equality, and fraternity sounds pretty good to a person in bondage, and so the slaves rebelled. This led to not one but two revolutions, and ended up with France, the rebels, Britain, and Spain all fighting in the territory. Spoiler alert: the slaves won. So how did the slaves of what would become Haiti throw off the yoke of one of the world's great empires? John Green tells how they did it, and what it has meant in Haiti and in the rest of the world.Crash Course World History is now available on DVD! http://store.dftba.com/products/crash...Follow us!@thecrashcourse@realjohngreen@raoulmeyer@crashcoursestan@saysdanica@thoughtbubblerLike us! http://www.facebook.com/youtubecrashc...Follow us again! http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.comSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse",history

A lot of students may find history boring and would rather focus on the here and now, but sometimes history can be surprising. Bizarre facts and events that we may not have learned about from our high school textbooks. Try as we may, not all information can be stored in a single textbook and history is not an exact science. Sometimes the things that are left out are believed to be ‘too sensitive’ or ‘vulgar’ for young people to hear about and needed to be censored. Other times it’s because it’s not deemed important enough or for convenience sake for different cultures. But these are some of those intriguing events and people that helped shaped the world as we know it today, whether we learned about them in school or not.While many of us would prefer to look to the future, history is a part of everyone’s lives.

Disease and invasive plant and animal species remade the New World, usually in negative ways. While native people, plants, and animals were being displaced in the Americas, the rest of the world was benefitting from American imports, especially foods like maize, tomatoes, potatoes, pineapple, blueberries, sweet potatoes, and manioc.

8EDlksmj26A,Computational History Group,"Helsinki Computational History Group (COMHIS, http://www.helsinki.fi/computational-...) is a multidisciplinary team that studies intellectual history. The work in the group is guided by methods from various different backgrounds ranging from modern data science and machine learning to history and linguistics.The main research objective of the group is an integrated study of public discourse and knowledge production that combines metadata from library catalogues as well as full-text libraries of books, newspapers and periodicals in early modern Europe. The group implements this strategy through different projects and is currently involved, for example, in a Finnish consortium to study the development of public discourse in Finland and in an international H2020 project entitled the NewsEye. Of the various historical periods that these projects focus on, the eighteenth-century and the Enlightenment play a central role in the group’s work.Why work on metadata?The core methodology of COMHIS research is shaped by open data analytical ecosystems. These provide transparent and reproducible approach for historical data analysis, as well as generic algorithmic tools that can be applied also more widely in related studies. In our work on metadata, we have harmonized and studied, for example, Fennica, Kungliga, Heritage of the Printed Book (by CERL) and ESTC catalogues. Within past couple year we have put particular efforts on the ESTC and are fast approaching a serious analysis phase on the publishers, edition field and authors in early modern Britain and North-America. One important objective is also to combine the ESTC metadata to full-texts of ECCO that we are also studying. It is our assumption that this will also change the way that one uses big historical data sets, such as ECCO, in text mining. This is something that regards everyone in digital humanities, so stay tuned!Did you know?In 2016, Helsinki Computational History Group was awarded an Open Science and Research Award by Finnish Ministry of Education.CollaborationBesides the mentioned funded projects, Helsinki Computational History Group collaborates actively with different partners from various countries and backgrounds. We are also constantly looking for new collaborators and partners, so please get in touch!",history

Benjamin Franklin published a book about Freemasonry on his own printing press. Nine signers of the Declaration of Independence were Freemasons, including the man with the biggest signature: Jon Hancock...Suspected throughout their long history of plotting to overtake the world accused of fomenting revolution and reviled as devil worshippers that stole King Solomon's treasure the Freemasons claim they're merely a civic-minded fraternity bound together by harmless rituals. Our high-energy cocktail of dramatic reenactment expert interviews and on-location footage entertains historians Akram Elias Stephen Bullock and Brent Morris to retell the Freemasons' central myth concerning Hiram Abiff mythical builder of Jerusalem's Temple of Solomon. During construction he was killed by three workers who believed his ""secret"" would impart magical powers--representing the three evils against which Freemasons believe they're still struggling: ignorance fanaticism and tyranny. Today the world's 2.5 million Freemasons meet to reenact the ritual of Hiram's murder as the initiation ceremony for the main rank of Master Mason.AMERICA: Is America the creation of the Freemasons? For hundreds of years suspicions of a plot to take over America have swirled around the Freemasons the world's oldest secret society. Freemasons led the Revolution framed the Declaration of Independence and Constitution designed our nation's capitaland in the early years of the Republic grew to unmatched heights of influence and power.

Te4zKla-BOU,UNSETTLING Discoveries That Might Change History,"You might not think so but history isn’t something that is set in stone.Subscribe to Talltanic http://goo.gl/wgfvrr#7 - Life On MarsSince it has been introduced, we as a society have gotten used to the idea that Mars and probably other planets once had life on them. Although this is something we’ve come to accept to be true, did you know that there is a whole new side of Mars’ history that we didn’t even know about? Although Mars doesn’t look like it now, NASA members have seen evidence on the planet’s surface that leads them to believe that there was once a massive ocean covering a large portion of the northern hemisphere. With that much water, they say that the planet could have been both warm and wet which is an even better breeding ground for life than previously thought. #6 - Akrotiri On TheraThe preserved excavation site pictured here is Akrotiri on Thera, a rich ancient city that could possibly be the source of the famous Atlantis. Just like what had happened to the poor people of Pompeii, the Aegean city of Akrotiri was also coated in a thick layer of ash preserving it throughout the ages. The eruption occurred in 1620 BC and wasn’t truly discovered until the 1960s. This almost perfectly preserved city shows an abundance of wealth that include some astounding paintings depicting Bronze Age life. This discovery gave the world a whole new look and understanding of the Mediterranean sea trade as well as Minoan art. #5 - Oracle Bone WritingThere has been a recent discovery that could mean the Chinese were among the first to discover the Americas. Scattered around the southern United States was a collection of 82 old stones that don’t look like they fit in with anything else from the surrounding native cultures. The messages on the rocks are messages written in Chinese oracle bone script. Oracle bone script is one of the oldest forms of Chinese writings known. When deciphering these messages, words describing a journey seems as though it was written by people exploring a new world. If this is true then that means that the Chinese landed in North America over 3,000 years ago. #4 - There Are More Mayan CitiesThe strange squarish platform pictured here is thought to be a huge Mayan city that was discovered by a 15-year-old named William Gadoury. This Canadian boy has a theory that Mayans chose to place their cities by following the constellations. After establishing this theory, he figured that there must be another undiscovered city in the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico and judging by this picture, it looks like he may be right. The place in question hasn’t been seen in person yet but there have been curious sighting from space which is prompting an expedition.#3 - There’s More To King Tut’s TombBeing lovers of ancient Egyptian history, we love the fact that there could possibly be more to King Tut’s tomb. When re-examining the chambers of the tomb with laser scans, Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves found what appeared to be not one but two additional, untouched chambers within the tomb. One of the chambers is thought to be hidden behind the wall you see in this picture. After being asked what he believed was behind door number one, Reeves said that he believes, and hopes, that it is the final resting place of Queen Nefertiti. Don’t worry, they aren’t going to just bring in a wrecking ball and smash in a wall, when they are ready to reveal what’s in the hidden tombs, they’ll most likely only drill tiny holes so they can insert cameras to look around. #2 - The Costa Rican SpheresIf the sphere pictured here looks familiar it's because they have been a hot topic since they’ve been seen all around Costa Rica, sitting out in the sunshine, hanging out underwater, or like the one pictured here, almost buried completely under the dirt. It turns out that these spheres were left adorning certain towns and buildings depending on the person or people’s importance or title. The process it took to actually create these near perfect stones was such a lengthy and involved one that these stone couldn’t be given to just anyone, they had to have some sort of major social standing. #1 - Metal BooksThe two ancient books you see here are actually ancient texts in the form of metal books. The collection found was a total of 70 of these tiny books that measured to be about the size of a credit card. On the pages of these books are symbols, characters, and markings that are believed to possibly unlock some of the most questioned secrets of some of the first days of Christianity. The things these books say could end up changing the way we understand the Bible. Although it appears as though some of the markings refer to a Messiah, a Crucifixion, and possibly even a Resurrection, no one has been able to understand the full context of the language written.",history

1-JAx3nUwms,A Brief History of Pi,"Get 10% off Squarespace by following this link: http://squarespace.com/simonclarkCheck out my new website here! https://www.simonoxfphys.com/Note that there's a huge amount about pi that I didn't cover in this video due to time - I didn't even mention proofs of it being irrational and transcendental, or why we call it pi! I chose to focus on the development of its approximation as a hook to teach the broader history of mathematics, rather than make this video an exhaustive list of facts. The wiki is a great place to learn more about the rest of the number's history and applications in maths and physics: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi#History A few nitpicky things:- I made mistakes distinguishing between 'digits of pi calculated' and 'decimal points of pi calculated' in some sections, so it is possible that this error is elsewhere without me knowing.- Archimedes didn't do his approximation with squares, he started with hexagons and then increased the order of the polygon. I chose to present the zeroth order version of his algorithm using squares for simplicity, but note that this is not what he did.- Something which got lost from the final version of this video is my argument that during the Age of Enlightenment pi shifted from being a physical (measured) constant to a purely logical (theoretical) one. This then embodies the philosophical shift in society at the time. This is hinted at but not fully explained, so I thought I'd put this here.- Lastly, I am truly sorry for the pronunciations which I doubtlessly completely murdered in this video. At least I spared you my attempt at Chinese.I am hugely indebted to Alex Bellos and his excellent book Alex's Adventures in Numberland for the inspiration to make this video. There is an entire chapter of the book devoted to a broader but shallower discussion of pi and its history, which I highly recommend.You can support the channel by donating at http://www.patreon.com/simonoxfphys---------- II ----------Huge thanks to my supporters on Patreon: Dan Hanvey, David Efird,  Elliot Conway, Robert Eldon, Syafiq Kay, Xavier Chesterfield, Jay Wright, Myles Kornfeld, Louis Gillet, Michael Phillips, Neudys Almonte, Fraser Birks, Martin Hermes, Anh Duong, Luca Schumann, Rhys Rickard-Frost, Cameron Matchett, Lachlan Woods, Tim Boxall, Simon Vaes, Gabriele Mozzicato, Jawad Alalasi, Gaia Frazao Nery, Kodzo, Josh Ruby, Claire Anthony, Eve Dillon, Rowan Gow, Matthias Loos, James Bridges, James Craig, Angela, Sanaa Al Derei, Mark Anthony Magro, Liam, Theresa Wang, Kieran Kelly, Wendover Productions, Kendra Johnson, Caitlin Louise.---------- II ----------Vlogs from Oxford students - http://www.youtube.com/oxvlogMy twitter - http://www.twitter.com/simonoxfphysMy facebook - http://www.facebook.com/youtubesimonMy insta - http://www.instagram.com/simonoxfphysMy goodreads - http://www.goodreads.com/simonoxfphysThanks to Vlogbrothers for their sponsorship of this video.

rY9zHNOjGrs,"The Civil War, Part I: Crash Course US History #20","In which John Green ACTUALLY teaches about the Civil War. In part one of our two part look at the US Civil War, John looks into the causes of the war, and the motivations of the individuals who went to war. The overarching causes and the individual motivations were not always the same, you see. John also looks into why the North won, and whether that outcome was inevitable. The North's industrial and population advantages are examined, as are the problems of the Confederacy, including its need to build a nation at the same time it was fighting a war. As usual, John doesn't get much into the actual battle by battle breakdown. He does talk a little about the overarching strategy that won the war, and Grant's plan to just overwhelm the South with numbers. Grant took a lot of losses in the latter days of the war, but in the end, it did lead to the surrender of the South.

Ajn9g5Gsv98,Slavery - Crash Course US History #13,"In which John Green teaches you about America's ""peculiar institution,"" slavery. I wouldn't really call it peculiar. I'd lean more toward horrifying and depressing institution, but nobody asked me. John will talk about what life was like for a slave in the 19th century United States, and how slaves resisted oppression, to the degree that was possible. We'll hear about cotton plantations, violent punishment of slaves, day to day slave life, and slave rebellions. Nat Turner, Harriet Tubman, and Whipped Peter all make an appearance. Slavery as an institution is arguably the darkest part of America's history, and we're still dealing with its aftermath 150 years after it ended.

alJaltUmrGo,Imperialism: Crash Course World History #35,"In which John Green teaches you about European Imperialism in the 19th century. European powers started to create colonial empires way back in the 16th century, but businesses really took off in the 19th century, especially in Asia and Africa. During the 1800s, European powers carved out spheres of influence in China, India, and pretty much all of Africa. While all of the major (and some minor) powers in Europe participated  in this new imperialism, England was by far the most dominant, once able to claim that the ""sun never set on the British Empire."" Also, they went to war for the right to continue to sell opium to the people of China. Twice. John will teach you how these empires managed to leverage the advances of the Industrial Revolution to build vast, wealth-generating empires. As it turns out, improved medicine, steam engines, and better guns were crucial in the 19th century conquests. Also, the willingness to exploit and abuse the people and resources of so-called ""primitive"" nations was very helpful in the whole enterprise.

John investigates when and where slavery originated, how it changed over the centuries, and how Europeans and colonists in the Americas arrived at the idea that people could own other people based on skin color. Slavery has existed as long as humans have had civilization, but the Atlantic Slave Trade was the height, or depth, of dehumanizing, brutal, chattel slavery. American slavery ended less than 150 years ago. In some parts of the world, it is still going on. So how do we reconcile that with modern life?

Free is nice, but if you can afford to pay a little every month, it really helps us to continue producing this content.In which John Green teaches you about American involvement in World War I, which at the time was called the Great War. They didn't know there was going to be a second one, though they probably should have guessed, 'cause this one didn't wrap up very neatly. So, the United States stayed out of World War I at first, because Americans were in an isolationist mood in the early 20th century. That didn't last though, as the affronts piled up and drew the US into the war. Spoiler alert: the Lusitania was sunk two years before we joined the war, so that wasn't the sole cause for our jumping in. It was part of it though, as was the Zimmerman telegram, unrestricted submarine warfare, and our affinity for the Brits. You'll learn the war's effects on the home front, some of Woodrow Wilson's XIV Points, and just how the war ended up expanding the power of the government in Americans' lives.Subbable message!!!: Jared Richardson says, ""All true love is beautiful.

Fate (and corrupt officials) conspired against him to have him repeatedly knocked down from the success he had earned, often because his insistence on strict military codes and refusal to ignore corruption made enemies of his fellow officers. Even when his superior had him tortured and blamed after a loss to the Jurchen raiders from the north, Yi perservered. Stripped of his rank and now reduced to a common enlisted man, Yi nevertheless served Korea with distinction. Meanwhile his childhood friend, Ryu Seong-ryong, had risen to become the prime minister of Korea. Ryu recognized the threat of war from Japan looming on the horizon, so when Yi asked to retire in 1588, Ryu convinced him to stay.____________Get the intro music here!http://bit.ly/1EQA5N7   *Music by Demetori: http://bit.ly/1AaJG4HGet the outro music here!http://bit.ly/1NbpIcd   *Music by Sean and Dean Kiner: http://bit.ly/1LBy9zh__________Extra History - Warring States Japan: Sengoku JidaiThe Battle of Okehazama: http://bit.ly/1xgZxfiExtra Credits - How Does Frame Rate Affect Gameplay?Frame Rate: http://bit.ly/1NQlx7t",history

pRK-cI1MpD8,Facial Recognition Offers New Insights into Architectural History,"Look at a map of roads or railroad tracks—the winding lines suffuse the terrain like veins in a body.That’s no accident, because “they are the stuff of life,” writes Peter Christensen, an assistant professor of art history.Trained as an architect as well as a scholar, Christensen is the author of a new book—Germany and the Ottoman Railways: Art, Empire, and Infrastructure (Yale, 2017)—that considers globalization through the lens of an immense civil works project that spanned cultures and borders in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.While buildings may be the glamourous figures in architecture, “infrastructure is what modernizes us,” Christensen says. And he argues that it deserves a place in architectural history not just as technology, but also as art.“Infrastructures make empires,” he declares on the book’s first page. “The economic, social, and cultural systems of empires are guided by and given form and purpose through canals, bridges, tunnels, ports, and, perhaps most importantly, railways.”And the construction of infrastructure is, at many levels, a collaborative one, crossing boundaries to take advantage of expertise and finances, and reliant not just on the vision of architects and engineers but of local laborers, too. “There are multiple layers of authorship involved in the creation of buildings and all the other objects that go into engineering a railway network,” says Christensen, who has also studied a similar effort in western Canada.Conceived of by the Ottoman sultan, the railways of the Ottoman Empire—which encompassed the lands of what are now Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq, Israel, and Greece—were largely a German project in engineering, materials, and finances. But the relationship between the two empires was always an ambiguous one. While the German Empire was a rising power during the Ottoman Empire’s decline, and the railway project was characterized by the international press as a colonial one, with Germany at the helm, the connection was more dynamic than antagonistic, Christensen argues. He finds testament to the cross-cultural nature of the effort in material artifacts of the Ottoman railway, including train stations, maps, bridges, and monuments. German architects created standard designs for the railway stations based on the size of the towns’ populations. But he didn’t see such replication when he studied the stations that were actually built. Instead, he found that key elements of design—the form of the windows, for instance, or the stone carving—were the handiwork of workers across the multicultural Ottoman Empire, laboring in different environmental conditions and drawing on their own cultural aesthetics. “This is the moment that crystalizes globalization in architecture,” Christensen says, “because styles are conflating freely, ideas and models of architecture are traveling and being changed.”His book is part of a larger project that also involves three-dimensional imaging. He and his research team have used 3D scanning to map precisely where the various Ottoman railway stations differ, zeroing in on the contributions of on-the-ground laborers, who typically figure little in architectural history. It’s a technology that he’s continuing to develop—with current collaborations at the Rochester Museum and Science Center and the Museum of Modern Art—to yield a tool he hopes will be broadly useful to architectural and art historians.  Christensen’s book is also the product of a low-tech but time-honored skill for art historians: scouring the archives. Few of the images that fill his book have been published before, but Christensen says the importance of the Ottoman railway continues to reverberate in contemporary life. “As recently as 100 years ago, the borders of these now geopolitical hotspots were completely different—and this railway was meant to connect these disparate lands,” he says. “After World War I, the border between Syria and Turkey was made by the railway line—it was an arbitrary line in the proverbial sand.“We live with the after effects of the creation of these networks to this day.”Help us caption & translate this video!https://amara.org/v/lodx/",history

Visit http://store.dftba.com/products/crash... to buy a set for your home or classroom.In which John Green teaches you about World War II, aka The Great Patriotic War, aka The Big One. So how did this war happen? And what does it mean? We've all learned the facts about World War II many times over, thanks to repeated classroom coverage, the History channel, and your grandfather (or maybe great-grandfather) showing you that Nazi bayonet he used to keep in his sock drawer and telling you a bunch of age-inappropriate stories about his harrowing war experiences.  So, why did the Axis powers think forceful expansion was a good idea? (they were hungry). So why did this thing shake out in favor of the Allies? HInt: it has to do with the fact that it was a world war.  Germany and Japan made some pretty serious strategic errors, such as invading Russia and attacking the United States, and those errors meant that pretty much the whole world was against them. So, find out how this worldwide alliance came together to stop the Axis expansion. All this, plus Canada finally gets the respectful treatment it deserves. Oh, and a warning: there are a few graphic images in this episode.

Farmers would build irrigation systems supporting villages and towns. Later some warrior would bring these towns under his rule and form a united political entity, like a kingdom or an empire. Then a tribe of nomads would come along and conquer the kingdom, seize all the holdings and settle in their place and further expand the new empire. As time went by the nomads would assimilate and become soft city dwellers. Exactly the kind of people they had conquered and at this point another tribe of nomads would come along and conquer them and take their empire.

This episode covers the rival alliances that dominated Europe in the build-up to war, the Triple Alliance and the Triple Entente, and the fatal gunshots by Gavrilo Princip at Sarajevo that resulted in the death of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Imperial rivalries, the system of alliances and deep-seated animosities helped propel Europe into a general war. However Woodrow Wilson, the US President, ensured America stood apart from Europe's conflict. In August 1914, Germany invaded France and Belgium as part of the Schlieffen Plan. The tiny British Expeditionary Force could only hold up the German army for a few hours at the Battle of Mons, but later joined the French in saving Paris at the Battle of the Marne. The 'Race to the Sea' followed, leading to the First Battle of Ypres, as both sides tried to outflank each other to the north. Their failure led to a stalemate, in which the devastating power of machineguns and artillery forced infantry of both sides to take cover in deep trenches. At sea, Britain's Royal Navy won the war's first naval battle at Heligoland Bight, and imposed a naval blockade on Germany, preventing war supplies (including, controversially, food) from reaching the country by sea. HMS Pathfinder was soon sunk by a German U-boat, revealing the potential of Germany's submarines to overturn Britain's long-held naval dominance.On the Eastern Front, a Russian invasion of East Prussia ended in disaster at the Battle of Tannenberg, masterminded by German generals Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff. A second victory at the Battle of Masurian Lakes sent the Russian army into retreat. Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia began badly, with defeat at the Battle of Cer. Things went even worse on the Russian front, as Austria's offensive against the Russians leads to heavy losses, and forced Germany to come to the rescue, by launching the Battle of Łódź.In Africa, British, French and German colonial forces clashed in British East Africa (Kenya), Togoland (Togo), German South-West Africa (Namibia), and German Kamerun (Cameroon). German Colonel Paul von Lettow-Vorbek had notable success repelling the British at the Battle of Tanga. In the Pacific, Japan honoured its alliance with Britain and seized the German naval base at Tsingtao in China. Task forces from Australia and New Zealand secured the German colonies of Samoa and New Guinea. German Admiral von Spee's East Asia Squadron won victory at the Battle of Coronel, off Chile, before sailing into catastrophe at the Battle of the Falkland Islands. In the Middle East, British troops occupied Basra, securing access to Persian oil for their fleet.Winter 1914 saw the French launch their first major offensive to break the trench stalemate of the Western Front. But the First Battle of Champagne led to heavy losses for no real gains. Ottoman operations in the Caucasus Mountains also ended in disaster at the Battle of Sarikamish. The war's first Christmas was marked by games of football in No Man's Land on the Western Front, but early hopes of a short war had now been entirely quashed.CORRECTION: 7.55 - the map shows Cyprus as part of the Ottoman Empire. Cyprus was part of the Ottoman Empire from 1570 to 1914, but when the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers in November 1914, Cyprus was annexed by Britain.

Was it the serial authoritarian regimes? The guillotine? The Reign of Terror? All of this and more contributed to the French Revolution not being quite as revolutionary as it could have been. France endured multiple constitutions, the heads of heads of state literally rolled, and then they ended up with a megalomaniacal little emperor by the name of Napoleon.

By way of providing context for this, John also talks a bit about wider America in the 1950s. The 1950s are a deeply nostalgic period for many Americans, but there is more than a little idealizing going on here. The 1950s were a time of economic expansion, new technologies, and a growing middle class. America was becoming a suburban nation thanks to cookie-cutter housing developments like the Levittowns.  While the white working class saw their wages and status improve, the proverbial rising tide wasn't lifting all proverbial ships. A lot of people were excluded from the prosperity of the 1950s. Segregation in housing and education made for some serious inequality for African Americans. As a result, the Civil Rights movement was born. John will talk about the early careers of Martin Luther King, Thurgood Marshall, Rosa Parks, and even Earl Warren. He'll teach you about Brown v Board of Education, and the lesser known Mendez vs Westminster, the Montgomery Bus Boycott, and all kinds of other stuff.Crash Course World History is now available on DVD!

Also, if you can afford to pay a little every month, it really helps keep the channel producing great content.In which John Green teaches you about the Progressive Era in the United States. In the late 19th and early 20th century in America, there was a sense that things could be improved upon. A sense that reforms should be enacted. A sense that progress should be made. As a result, we got the Progressive Era, which has very little to do with automobile insurance, but a little to do with automobiles. All this overlapped with the Gilded Age, and is a little confusing, but here we have it. Basically, people were trying to solve some of the social problems that came with the benefits of industrial capitalism. To oversimplify, there was a competition between the corporations' desire to keep wages low and workers' desire to have a decent life. Improving food safety, reducing child labor, and unions were all on the agenda in the Progressive Era. While progress was being made, and people were becoming more free, these gains were not equally distributed. Jim Crow laws were put in place in the south, and immigrant rights were restricted as well. So once again on Crash Course, things aren't so simple.Hey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit's free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode.

Remember it, Share it and maybe, just maybe, we can be great again!The point of this video? Not to create animosity nor give an audience to hateful statements from people who, because of their own apathy, in part created the world we now live. The point of this video is to make anyone who cares to pull together and stop the down fall as best as they can. To be good to one another and stop blaming everybody else for our own short comings. To heal ourselves so that we can heal others. Not as separate parts, but as a whole sum of Humanity!This video has now been seen in 190+ countries!Still people don't seem to be getting the point.I am a human being just as you. Doing things for the right reasons just as you.If you're not treating your fellow man (Mankind) (Human Beings) with compassion, or at least treating them as you would be treated, then how are you helping the situation.And if you're not helping the situation, then what are you doing?Its not about invisible lines that divide us rather human qualities that unit us.It's a lie to think your not good enough. There are two entities in the world.1. Evil This is where one feels Anger, Jealousy, Greed, Resentment, Lies, and Inferiority.2. Goodness This is where one feels Joy, Peace, Love, Hope, Humility, Kindness, Empathy and Truth.As I read over the comments I see both Evil and Goodness shared. It is not a country that is evil or good. Rather it is a personal choice of the people in any country to be either Good or Evil. And they do so through their actions.",history

ZTC_RxWN_xo,Secret History of Silicon Valley,"[Recorded: November 20, 2008]Today, Silicon Valley is known around the world as a fount of technology innovation and development fueled by private venture capital and peopled by fabled entrepreneurs. But it wasn't always so. Unbeknownst to even seasoned inhabitants, today's Silicon Valley had its start in government secrecy and wartime urgency.In this lecture, renowned serial entrepreneur Steve Blank presents how the roots of Silicon Valley sprang not from the later development of the silicon semiconductor but instead from the earlier technology duel over the skies of Germany and secret efforts around (and over) the Soviet Union. World War II, the Cold War and one Stanford professor set the stage for the creation and explosive growth of entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley. The world was forever changed when the Defense Department, CIA and the National Security Agency acted like today's venture capitalists funding this first wave of entrepreneurship. Steve Blank shows how these groundbreaking early advances lead up to the high-octane, venture capital fueled Silicon Valley we know today.Catalog Number: 102695046Lot Number: X5082.2009",history

In the sense of its temperature. It was by no means cool, man.  After World War II, there were basically two big geopolitical powers left to divide up the world. And divide they did. The United States and the Soviet Union divvied up Europe in the aftermath of the war, and then proceeded to spend the next 45 years fighting over the rest of the world. It was the great ideological struggle, with the US on the side of capitalism and profit, and the USSR pushing Communism, so-called. While both sides presented themselves as the good guy in this situation, the reality is that there are no good guys. Both parties to the Cold War engaged in forcible regime changes, built up vast nuclear arsenals, and basically got up to dirty tricks. If you had to pick a bad guy though, I would point out that the USSR had no intention of bringing Laika the Cosmonaut Dog home alive. That poor dog never had a shot.Sorry to disappoint, but the economist t-shirts are not a real product.Thanks to Raoul Meyer for the YUGOGAL photo.Crash Course World History is now available on DVD! http://store.dftba.com/products/crash...Follow us:@thecrashcourse@realjohngreen@raoulmeyer@crashcoursestan@thoughtbubbler@saysdanicaLike us!: http://www.facebook.com/youtubecrashc...Support Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse",history

daVaEoF5Hrk,Arnold Schönberg - Wassily Kandinsky: Music and Art Get One,"The early years of the 20th Century signed a terrific advance in the Physical Sciences. The Special (1905) and General (1916)  Theories of Relativity and the advent of Quantum Mechanics (1926) changed our lives profoundly. Around the same years, a similar revolution took place in both Music and Art. The year 1909 marks a decisive break with tonality (the structure of classical music) by Arnold Schönberg in his ""Three Piano Pieces"". The term 'Atonality' is commonly used to express this new type of composition. Wassily Kandinsky is credited with painting the first 'purely abstract' works. His production is vast and I could only include 20 of his works here, selected from a period of time that overlaps with the musical pieces by Schönberg presented in this video. They knew each other and have possibly influenced their works reciprocally. The video is an attempt to evince this intriguing 'connection' between music and painting.About Arnold Schönberg (1874-1951):...The final piece (of the Three Piano Pieces, Op.11) breaks through all constraints of traditional language or structure, cutting abruptly from extremes of eruptive power, as in the massively congested opening, to the most intense introspection. Perhaps Schoenberg had in mind Kandinsky, with whom he had close  contacts, when he likened such music to developments in painting -""without architecture... an ever-changing, unbroken succession of colours, rhythms and moods."" (From a Text by Peter Hill).About Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944):...As the ""Der Blaue Reiter""(*) Almanac essays and theorizing with composer Arnold Schönberg indicate, Kandinsky also expressed the communion between artist and viewer as being available to both the senses and the mind (Synesthesia). Hearing tones and chords as he painted, Kandinsky theorized that, for instance, yellow is the colour of middle C on a brassy trumpet; black is the colour of closure, and the end of things; and that combinations of colours produce vibrational frequencies, akin to chords played on a piano. Kandinsky also developed a theory of geometric figures and their relationships, claiming, for example, that the circle is the most peaceful shape and represents the human soul.

k7ngnWJ6Hks,Music is a visual art | Hunter Ewen | TEDxBoulder,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. We can use visuals to better describe music. Hunter Ewen is a dramatic music composer, educator, and multimedia designer. During the day, Dr. Ewen teaches strategies for digital creativity at the University of Colorado, the children’s collaborative art center Reel Kids, the City of Longmont, and as an independent educator. At night, he composes, solders, choreographs, and directs interdisciplinary projects around the world. Experimental performance practices and unusual notation figure prominently in Ewen’s works. A believer that compositions should be both seen and heard, his music looks as strange as it sounds. Swirles, squiggles, arrows, and fangs often replace traditional notes and rests. His aesthetic preferences gravitate towards yowls and yips and wails and squeals. Towards screams that masquerade as art. Towards clamor and deviance. Ewen’s music swings from chandeliers.About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",art

Now, his interests lie in the role of art, music and technology in neural functioning and the advancement of medicine.

d8VA7_qSC7U,With One Voice in Montreal: Art and Music Helping Homeless People.,"""Art to me is a humanitarian act and I believe that there is a responsibility that art should somehow be able to effect mankind, to make the world a better place.""  ~ Jeff KoonsSomething I don't talk about very often is that at its very core Invisible People is art. Years ago, my boss at the time had in his office a coffee table book of photos of homeless people. The pictures humanized homeless men, woman, and families as the real people that they are. I said to myself: ""I could do this with video."" Shortly after, I was laid off and Invisible People was started. If you'd like to learn more about my story and how Invisible People started, please watch this documentary https://youtu.be/z0wDn9SAWZsArt and music have the power to bring people together and change our world for the better. Both art and music can play a huge role in giving homeless people a purpose. Yes, housing ends homelessness but just putting homeless people in boxes will never end homelessness. People need to thrive and not just survive. Art therapy and music therapy are powerful tools for wellness, and as you'll see in this vlog - art, music, and theater can be used for advocacy to help change policy. Last year, With One Voice sent a delegation to the ATSA État d'Urgence Festival in Montreal, Canada. It was an amazing few days meeting new friends and brainstorming on how we can help other creative organizations scale to have more impact helping homeless people. I shot a bunch of footage but never got around to editing it into something until this month. My dream is someday to be able to produce mini-documentaries like this vlog highlighting cool ideas and amazing people working to end homelessness who may not always get a lot of media attention.  For example, in this vlog, I reference a video I shot when I was invited to the Dallas Public Library that you can watch here: https://youtu.be/_SaG0xR7xkU The folks behind With One Voice saw this video and invited Jo and Heather to Montreal to share about creating safe spaces. I hope to one day be able to produce more like this but on a much larger scale! In her interview, Beth Knowles from the City of Manchester and With One Voice references the North America Review of Arts and Homelessness that you can find here: http://with-one-voice.com/north-ameri...From With One Voice's website: With One Voice began as a showcase event curated by Streetwise Opera at the 2012 Cultural Olympiad in London. For the first time in Olympic history, it gave a platform for homeless people – celebrating the artistic achievements of 300 performers who had experienced homelessness.To learn more about the people and the organizations in this video, here is a link to information about the delegates https://www.atsa.qc.ca/en/eu-2017-wit...

One story at a time, videos posted on InvisiblePeople.tv shatter the stereotypes of America’s homeless, force shifts in perception and deliver a call to action that is being answered by national brands, nonprofit organizations and everyday citizens now committed to opening their eyes and their hearts to those too often forgotten.Invisible People is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to changing the way we think about people experiencing homelessness.",art

The Aboriginal communities at Milingimbi and Yirrkala, together with the people at Galiwin'ku (previously known as Elcho Island) have been referred to in the anthropological literature as the Murngin (WL Warner) and Wulamba (RM Berndt). More recently, they have become known as the Yolngu, from a local word meaning 'people'. The people on Groote Eylandt were known by mainland groups as the Wayingurra and their language, Ingurra. In the absence of a name for the Groote Eylandters, Warnindilyakwa, a name formerly given to one of the larger clans on the island, is sometimes used. Anindilyakwa is the name of the island language. Item characteristics of Eastern Arnhem Land clan songs performed and recorded in the 1960s-all of which were sung by men-are summarised here as follows: (1) a didjeridu accompaniment which utilises two tones differing widely in pitch (the interval between the higher or overblown tone and the fundamental often sounding close to a tenth but varying according to the shape and length of the hollowed branch); (2) a narrow vocal range of pitch (compare them, for instance, with Western Arnhem Land songs) which rarely exceeds a fifth or sixth and may be less than a second; (3) song words which are translatable, meaningful and appropriate to relevant clan territories and related myths; and (4) the occurrence of an unaccompanied vocal termination (UVT), or termination of a song item by voice or voices alone after the accompanying instruments have ceased. Good examples of this fourth item characteristic are to be heard on this disc (Track 1) and disc 3 (Track 11). Song refrains may consist of repeated strings of words and syllables, a prolonged single syllable or a repeated pattern of vocal sounds (for example, bird calls). These calls are incorporated into the particular sectional or phraselike structure of many item sequences performed in Eastern Arnhem Land. On Groote Eylandt (tracks 7-13), only the first three of the above characteristics are to be heard. There is no occurrence of the UVT in these items but the following additional characteristics distinguish emeba (Groote Eylandt clan songs) from manikay (north-eastern Arnhem Land clan songs): a. the shaky voice, a deliberate manner of vocal ornamentation used by some emeba singers; b. the break or brief cessation of the vocal part of a Groote Eylandt clan song which is signalled by certain words the singer chooses to sing (the song subject at this point may fall, swoop down, or change abruptly in some way-it was said that the break gives the singer time to decide which words to sing next); c. a short, patterned interplay between sticks and didjeridu during the break; and d. the general clatter of stick-beating percussion arising from several different sources at the same time. Further comparison of emeba and manikay reveals that, whereas the durations of the latter are usually about one minute or less, emeba items may last for more than two minutes each.Manikay.comIt is such a shame that so much aboriginal culture has been lost .. Its good to see that some remains .",art

If he had Record Company, Drug Cartel, Big Pharma, Government Military money he probably could be. Why? Because kids, you can buy your way to the top in this game we are all playing. Don't think you are a part of it? Think again and hit the books. So till the scales tip and above becomes below he will be frequently relocated to earth to fulfill his soul contract after numerous other glorious failed attempts.  He is passionate about making intimate and poignant songs using outdated and unreliable equipment in his living room. He's scrappy, hungry, skilled at burning bridges and primed to explode at any moment. Possibly implode. Art and Music's highly unanticipated second album “Who are They”, is a completely independent release. Jones produced, recorded, engineered and performed every instrument on this release, highlighting his versatility and broad musical scope. Further demonstrating his sheer insanity.One of the most exciting things about Art and Music is that Jones can exercise full creative control over every stage of the music-making experience, from conception to fruition!He blissfully watches mindless robot sheep perpetuate in consumer stupor, narrowly avoiding mental breakdowns most of the time.

0ADbFQkHyto,Music Art Meditation - Relax Your Mind and Soul with Art and Music,"Music Art Meditation provides you with a novel method of meditation to relax your Mind and Soul with Art and Music! Stay focused!Arguably, all music can be said to be useful for Meditation. The styles, cadences, arpeggiations, and rhythms of meditational music for contemplative practices is characteristically different than most other forms of music. Generally speaking, the music is relaxing, lacking definitive rhythms. Meditation and music have been relational partners for centuries. Mellow, repetitive, and redundant sequences of smoothly contoured melodic lines help to relax the mind as arrhythmic tempos do not distract the listener into a beat but rather a flow. Harmonies are often absent unless one accepts the musical nuance of imitation as structured harmony. Meditation music can also include recordings of sounds in the ""natural"" world: rainfall, waterfalls, birds, insects, whales, and others, separately and in synthetic combination.In the recent years, it was scientifically proven that relaxing art techniques combined with music is one of the best ways forward as it guarantees rapid positive results. So, our main goal is to share this relaxation method with you all.Music Art Meditation - Experience the Whole New Meditation Technique Using Music and Art!👍 Like 💬Comment ✅Share and ❤️Subscribe: Click on the Bell 🔔 to be Notified First to View 👀 the Videos!© MusicArtMeditation - MaM© #MusicArtMeditation-----------------------------------------------------Music Credits:""Tristan Lohengrin - The End Of The World"" is under a Creative Commons license (CC BY 3.0).Music promoted by BreakingCopyright: https://youtu.be/vp2xrvXh9M0-----------------------------------------------------",art

jvYTiPQAyAE,How art and music create a new hybrid global culture: Rajae El Mouhandiz at TEDxBreda,"The ""one story"" of Muslims and immigrants we hear in the news and politics every day is ignoring the many stories of millions of women and men who do not see themselves in that old story, but as authors and owners of a new story where globalism and hybrid cultures are the stage and vehicle. They represent a new story of being and belonging in the world. A story where history is honoured as the sacrifices of those who came before us. Their parents moved to the west to start something new, mixed with the old, and individuals like Rajae El Mouhandiz are the product. As the new stories they are shaping do not yet have a language and a platform, one has to start telling the stories through art and music. And personal strength.Regarding Rajae El MouhandizRajae El Mouhandiz is a Dutch-Moroccan-Algerian poet, singer, composer, producer, and founder of the record label Truthseeker Records. After leaving her family at age 15 and being the first Moroccan to study at a Dutch conservatory at age 16. El Mouhandiz left classical music at age 20 to follow her own artistic path, seeking to incorporate her cultural roots. She started her own record label at age 25, released two albums and is currently developing her third album in Morocco. On international women's day 2013 El Mouhandiz premiered her first short documentary film, about the acceptance of Muslim women in mainstream media and the music industry. Currently she is developing her second short film, focusing on her Maghreb heritage and the story of her grandfathers. She is also one of the 60 female curators of the groundbreaking international MUSLIMA exhibition, held in The USA, The Philipines, The U.A.E and Denmark. And together with the British Council Ireland and a Dutch theatre production company, El Mouhandiz is producing the Dutch and European version of the Hijabi Monologues; a theatre space for the experiences of Muslim women; a space to breathe as they are; a space that does not claim to tell every story and speak for every voice. The Dutch premiere is planned in September 2014. Rajae was nominated as Muslim Leader of tomorrow in 2005. She was nominated by Elsevier magazine as one of Hollands' 10 biggest talents in 2007, in the field of contemporary music and from 2009 -- 2012 she was the only female contemporary artist to be nominated on the list of the 500 most influential Muslims in the world. This year Rajae has been nominated for the 5th year in a row. More information: www.rajae.net",art

CQ4gxP2NGiQ,"Mathematics, Music, and Visual Art","Bridges 4: Mathematics, Music, and Visual ArtOur talks will explore some of the many connections between mathematics, music, and visual arts, using as a springboard our collaborative work-in-progress with the Kitchener-Waterloo symphony, to be premiered in April 2016. Dmitri will begin by describing the deep similarities between the languages of music and geometry, showing how elementary musical terms like “chord” and “voice leading” correspond to geometrical concepts like “vectors in an orbifold.” This correspondence in turn allows us to appreciate the hidden logic of particular pieces, the development of styles, and entire genres. Nathan will continue by showing how mathematical ideas can underwrite visually and conceptually striking visual art. The speakers will then join forces to describe some of the challenges and opportunities of using these ideas in creating a multimedia performance.Nathan Selikoff plays with interactivity and motion in time and space. Inspired by the behavior of systems, science, nature, and music, he combines computer code, traditional materials, and future technology to bring new ideas to life. His award-winning artwork has been exhibited and performed in galleries and venues throughout the United States and around the world. Selikoff is represented by Snap! Space in Florida, Bangkok, and Amsterdam.Dmitri Tymoczko’s book A Geometry of Music is available from Oxford University Press, and his CDs Beat Therapy and Crackpot Hymnal are available from Bridge Records.

OxI6uPQwu8I,Composer Chat 03 - Art and Music - Limitation as Freedom,"I am discussing the concept of limitation in the context of artistic freedom. When I am faced with the whiteness of my creative page, I like to set limiting parameters before I begin my work. Choosing to limit my creative output can bring focus and direction. The following are a few examples of the concept of limitation:1. Georgia O'Keeffe uses soft and wavy curves in her paintings (example: Flower of Life II)2. Claude Debussy focuses on the pentatonic and the octatonic scales in his compositions.3. The game of chess limits the movements of the pieces both collectively and individually.Join me for more talks about art, inspiration, and all things creative.This episode features the music from my album Lacrimosa: http://www.dosiamckay.com/lacrimosa.s...My website: http://dosiamckay.com/My compositions: http://www.dosiamckay.com/recordings....My paintings: http://www.dosiamckay.com/art/gallery...My writing and poetry: https://musicwell.wordpress.com/Follow meFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dosiamckay/Twitter: https://twitter.com/dosiamckayGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+DosiaMcKayYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/dosiamckay",art

The Theta / Beta frequencies range from 6-7hz & 13-15hz respectively, with 8-12hz alpha waves interspersed throughout. The patterns switch in the following manner, every 5 minutes: 0-5 mins - Alpha / Beta; 5-10 mins - Theta / Alpha; 10 - 15 mins -Alpha / Beta; etc. etc.  up to one hour. This quick interplay between beta and theta/alpha promotes a balance between concrete thought and creative abstraction. This way we can encourage and bring to light new insights, generate new & original ideas, contemplate a concept from various points of view, and problem solve holistically. The beta phases serve to not only promote focus and concentration, but to also analyse, organise and therefore make sense of the abstractions derived from the more non linear holistic mind states induced by Theta and Alpha. In addition to using this audio during work or study, you can also use it in a rested state while meditating to assist with creative visualisation. As binaural beats have been integrated into this track, we recommend using headphones. Subscribe to The Brainwave Hub for the best brainwave entrainment audios, as well as our partner channel, The Meditation Music Hub: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCydP...--The Brainwave Hub offers high quality binaural beats and isochronic tones.

SDmdsuGr3KQ,Katawa Shoujo Beta - Shizune Act 3 (Full Art and Music),"Here is Shizune's Act 3. The official Steam forum dedicated to repairing the beta routes did not completely finish giving Shizune's route art and music direction, so I fixed it up myself. Knowing how to mod has never generated so many feels.This is a playthrough of Shizune's Act 3 in the Beta of Katawa Shoujo. Act 1 was skipped due to it being exactly the same aside from the music and some grammar errors. Act 2 has been uploaded at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z3Rmw... I will upload Act 4 at some point in time, but I figured I should at least upload something pertaining to the beta route as of now instead of holding off everything.I decided to keep the beta music in, but upon my insertion of art and music I put in some of the final version's music instead. The beta music just seems to fit the majority of the story in this route much better.I came across a rather disturbing, yet slightly expected option in the beta that was either omitted or never finished. As it turns out, you could end up having sex with Misha at Shizune's house. During the scene where Misha confesses her love for Shizune, there was going to be a decision at some point in the conversation where you could choose to comfort her or refuse. If you do not comfort her, she tells you that she had a selfish thought that you would (this is shown at about 1:23:34 in the video) This effects multiple scenes, the most notable one being that Hisao and Misha agree to never tell Shizune about the affair. This in turn would not actually effect the story at all, but feelings of utter guilt would be inserted throughout many scenes. The most ridiculous part is that you could still get a good ending with Shizune, even after cheating on her, but I'll get into more detail about that once Act 4 comes along. For now, I will hold off the spoilers.Katawa Shoujo is a bishoujo-style visual novel set in the fictional Yamaku High School for disabled children, located somewhere in modern Japan. Hisao Nakai, a normal boy living a normal life, has his life turned upside down when a congenital heart defect forces him to move to a new school after a long hospitalization. Despite his difficulties, Hisao is able to find friends—and perhaps love, if he plays his cards right. There are five main paths corresponding to the 5 main female characters, each path following the storyline pertaining to that character. This is the beta.",art

In the animal kingdom, song and visual displays are great tools for, um, flirting.Read more at BigThink.com: http://bigthink.com/videos/bill-nye-o...Follow Big Think here:YouTube: http://goo.gl/CPTsV5Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BigThinkdotcomTwitter: https://twitter.com/bigthinkTranscript: Michael Montoya: Hi Bill. Michael Montoya here. What do you think is the evolutionary advantage to humanity being both musically and artistically creative? And where do you think this initial spark of creativity came from?Bill Nye: Michael. Michael. This is a great question and susceptible to speculation. Apparently music and art is part of the way we communicate and it's certainly the way you attract mates. I'll just put it to you that way. Musicians and artists engage other people in a way that people who don't use music and don't use art do not. Now, there's a lot of talk about songbirds in evolutionary biology and they all have these songs, which must be pleasing to the ears of their potential mates and also must send messages to others of their species, so I guess to other species as well. I am angry; this is my territory; I'm looking for a mate; it's a sunny day. These sort of announcements are made by other species so you figure humans have just taken it just a whole other level with albums and record release parties and art exhibits and art museums and art galleries. So it really is deep within us and I think art enriches our lives, engages our brains and stimulates us in a way that nothing else we do does. So, this is only speculation on my part but music especially certainly inspires us. That's for sure. So carry on Michael. Turn it up loud.",art

pP0Rlw8mo8g,Is Music Art? – Hangout on Air,"In our fifth and final 'Hangout on Air', Miranda Sawyer is joined by artist Haroon Mirza, music producer Will Skeaping, record sleeve designer Leif Podhajsky and Tate's Adrian Shaw for a lively discussion about music and art.Miranda Sawyer is a journalist, writer and broadcaster covering a wide range of interests, including music, art, radio and theatre. She is currently a feature writer and radio critic for The Observer, and is a regular arts critic in print and on television and radio. Miranda is also on the board of Tate Members.Haroon Mirza is a British artist who combines a variety of readymade and time based material to create audio compositions, which are often realised as site-specific installations. In doing so, Mirza complicates the distinctions between noise, sound and music, and alters the function and meaning of everyday objects and and socio-cultural constructs.Adrian Shaw is part of Tate’s Learning department, working on the Young People’s Programme. He has been organising music events since the early 1990’s and introduced large scale music programming to Tate over 10 years ago.  Now established as ‘Late at Tate’, these events often explore the boundaries between music, performance and art.  Adrian is also a musician, and one half of the arts duo boyleANDshaw.Will Skeaping is a creative consultant and music producer. Following a tour of duty at Google, he worked closely with rappers, authors and film makers as label manager at Lex Records, focusing on collaborations between artists and musicians. He is currently making an album uniting English folk music with vintage analogue synthesizers. Leif Podhajsky is an Australian artist and graphic designer, who’s distinctive bright, surreal abstractions have featured on posters and album covers for musicians including Mount Kimbie, Tame Impala, Grimes, Lykki Li and Foals. Leif says his work “explores themes of connectedness, the relevance of nature and the psychedelic or altered experience.”This is an archived version of the 'Music meets Art' Hangout On Air that took place on 9 December 2013 at Tate Britain: http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-...",art

Tom Conti is a musician and composer with a passion for music. The two artists have combined their talents to create this art and music therapy video “Through The Struggle”. This classical piece is composed by Tom Conti, and is one of 12 on his latest album, which is based upon the fact that we have physical and emotional reactions to certain musical progressions and patterns. Tom says of his music ""The fact that we compose them to help individuals reduce stress, anxiety, restlessness and emotional imbalances in a very natural way is no coincidence.”See more of Lynette’s artwork at http://hhlimited.com/portfolio/Hear more of Tom’s compositions at https://contimusic.com",art
XCRbISUfU2Y,Convergence 2016: Electronic Music + Visual Art,"When it comes to Electronic Music + Visual Art, we have entered into a post-instrument era in which music and visual art born of technology produce contemporary, dynamic and convergent new forms. Traditional apparatus and techniques are displaced by computer based processes, virtual instruments, electronic hardware and custom machines, stems, patches, waveforms and midi. This inaugural residency welcomes artists working in rhythmic and experimental electronic music realms, digital visual artists, and those pursuing work that creates synergies between sound, music and art.This Banff Centre residency provided the context for artists to research, conceive, prototype and present new artistic works, tools, techniques and perspectives for electronic music, sound, and visual creation. Under the artistic direction of Patti Schmidt and Jen Mizuik, and led by faculty Robin Fox and Uwe Schmidt with guest faculty who are specialists in their fields, the program offered sessions and workshops on modular synthesizers, electronic music software and hardware, visual creation software and methods, artistic process and philosophy, and the nature of live performance in these technologically dominated fields. Together artists, peers, and world-renowned faculty exchanged knowledge, discussed ideas, experimented with processes, created, collaborated, performed, and shared artistic experiences.Artists presented their works-in-progress throughout the program. The nature of the practices involved determined the presentation format and ranged from live performances, informal presentations, installations, talks and workshops. Artists received technical and artistic guidance during the development of their projects and research. This video gives a glimpse into the coolness that was the 2016 Convergence Residency.Follow the Banff Centre:Website: https://banffcentre.caFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheBanffCentreTwitter: https://twitter.com/thebanffcentreiTunes: http://apple.co/1A2DMmxSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/banff-centre-r...",art

By investigating the fundamental geometric forms of both Islamic art and Gothic architecture, there is a connection between religious influence, visual creativity and architectural  structure that strengthens physical capacity to the human experience. Relating these two art forms to music theory provides an introduction to the progress of music sciences in the modern age; including Cymatics, a 20th century science of wave phenomenon that demonstrates various geometric shapes of frequencies and musical pitch. This interdisciplinary approach of visualizing the common geometric forms of art, architecture, and music questions the anticipatory influence and outlook of the arts for future generations.",art

WJaR7rJqKIk,"Art and Incarceration:  Poetry, Theatre and Music in and about Captivity","For this interdisciplinary performance, Ensemble Pi presented music, text, and theater works that focus on the rise of mass incarceration, the racial disparities it reveals, and the emotional toll it takes on inmates and their families. The evening started with the world premiere of Rikers Island by New York composer Eleanor Cory, inspired by the anthology These Are Hard Times for Dreamers. Followed by Rzewski’s minimalist masterpiece, Coming Together, composed in the wake of the 1971 prison riots in upstate New York and powerfully expressing the frustration of life behind bars and anger about injustice. Joseph Assadourian, the narrator for Coming Together, will also perform an excerpt from his tragi-comic play, The Bullpen, based on his own incarceration. The performance closed with the sublime Olivier Messiaen’s Quartet for the End of Time (1941), composed and performed in the prisoner-of-war camp in Gorlitz, Germany, capturing the hardship and sadness of being in prison, while still conveying optimism.About the presenters:Ensemble Pi is a new music collective that uniquely connects pressing social and political issues and the idioms of classical contemporary music. They began a Peace Concerts series 10 years ago in response to the invasion of Iraq, and have since presented annual chamber music concerts giving voice to the struggle for peace. Every concert includes at least one commission, as well as contemporary classical masterpieces to address the historical tradition of “socially conscious” compositions. In the past, the group has collaborated with visual artists, writers, journalists and actors – including South African artist William Kentridge and American journalists Naomi Wolf and Jeremy Scahill – and have featured the music of John Harbison, Frederic Rzewski, Shostakovich and Penderecki. The Peace Concerts series has also protested the censorship of media, fracking, the Apartheid, and more. Performers include: Alexis Gerlach, cello; Moran Katz, clarinet; Idith Meshulam Korman, piano; Airi Yoshioka, violin; and Joseph Assadourian, actor and narrator. The group is joined by local Houston musicians Craig Hauschildt, percussion and Daniel Egan, trumpet.c Rothko Chapel/Runaway Productions",art

It became the symbol of the magic and power of music. The lute was the instrument of kings and queens, playing the sublime music of great composers. The lute was heard in the theatre in the incidental music of Shakespeare's plays. And the lute was heard by common people, playing the popular tunes of the day in pubs and on street corners.The lute is the descendent of the Arabic Oud which traveled into Europe during the time of the Crusades. From the beginning, the lute had a pear-shaped body, a rounded back made of separate strips of wood, and a bent-back pegbox.he Early Music movement of the late twentieth century saw a new generation of lutenists dedicated to rediscovering the old performance practices. The tremendous beauty, variety and color of Renaissance and Baroque lute music can now be heard in their performances. And the amazing musical flexibility of the lute is revealed through new compositions, written in a variety of styles. After two hundred years of neglect, the future of the lute once again looks bright.* The music published in this channel is exclusively dedicated to divulgation artwork and songs.Gathering people that like the genre and style.

But along with this new type of compression, Bocko's team of engineers and musicians at Rochester's Eastman School of Music are also helping uncover some extraordinarily precise details about just how music is made. With support from the National Science Foundation, they have built a computer model of the clarinet, entirely from real world acoustical measurements taken from human musicians. Measuring such things as how hard the musician is blowing into the instrument and the pressure the musician applies to the reed, they have modeled the way music is made. Their work could evolve into a cool new tool for music teachers and help create more expressive, more emotional computer generated musical sounds.

9RQ-Ha9JmpI,"The Harlem Renaissance:  The Rise of African American Literature, Art, and Music","This short film, produced and created by Rob Johnson of San Rafael, CA,  is an introduction to an interdisciplinary unit on the Music, Art, and Literature of the Harlem Renaissance. The Harlem Renaissance (also known as the Black Literary Renaissance and the New Negro Movement) refers to the flowering of African American cultural and intellectual life during the 1920s and 1930s. At the time, it was known as the ""New Negro Movement"", named after the 1925 anthology The New Negro edited by Alain Locke. Centered in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, the movement impacted urban centers throughout the United States. Across the cultural spectrum (literature, drama, music, visual art, dance) and also in the realm of social thought (sociology, historiography, philosophy), artists and intellectuals found new ways to explore the historical experiences of black America and the contemporary experiences of black life in the urban North. Challenging white paternalism and racism, African-American artists and intellectuals rejected imitating the styles of Europeans and white Americans and instead celebrated black dignity and creativity. Asserting their freedom to express themselves on their own terms, they explored their identities as black Americans, celebrating the black culture that had emerged out of slavery, as well as cultural ties to Africa. The Harlem Renaissance had a profound impact not only on African-American culture but also on the cultures of the African diaspora. Afro-Caribbean artists and intellectuals from the British West Indies, who had migrated to New York in number, were part of the movement. Moreover, many French-speaking black writers from African and Caribbean colonies who lived in Paris were also influenced by the Harlem Renaissance.[1] Historians disagree as to when the Harlem Renaissance began and ended. It is unofficially recognized to have spanned from about 1919 until the early or mid 1930s. Many of its ideas lived on much longer. The zenith of this ""flowering of Negro literature"", as James Weldon Johnson preferred to call the Harlem Renaissance, is placed between 1924 (the year that Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life hosted a party for black writers where many white publishers were in attendance) and 1929 (the year of the stock market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression). In 1917 Hubert Harrison, ""The Father of Harlem Radicalism,"" founded the Liberty League and The Voice, the first organization and the first newspaper of the ""New Negro Movement"". Harrison's organization and newspaper were political, but also emphasized the arts (his newspaper had ""Poetry for the People"" and book review sections). In 1927, in the Pittsburgh Courier, Harrison challenged the notion of the renaissance. He argued that the ""Negro Literary Renaissance"" notion overlooked ""the stream of literary and artistic products which had flowed uninterruptedly from Negro writers from 1850 to the present"", and said the so-called ""renaissance"" was largely a white invention.

The vocal and choral group by name ""Arioso"" by  woman conductor  E.S.Senckevich, always amazes with it's many tember voices and vocal singing skills, the ability to perform virtuosly work in one breath there. But this time, the guys have surpassed themselves, I'm think. Valentina Alontseva, Yaroslav Kisilyov, with her playing the accordion, showed how close this instrument is to them too. Egor Zimenkov, Ivan Stepantsov, Ali Isengaliev, Alexei Baranov with the support of teacher of children's schools by accordion class N.A. Shvydkovoy forced the viewer no breath. Polina Galitskaya, Maria Gulak, Maria Oleinikova, Sarsen Incarbekova (upright piano) and others were able to subordinate grand piano, make it laugh and sob theirs playing. The performance of Nikita Kutakhin and Andrei Kulzhanov, known as the duo ""NikAnder"", took place nice again.The ""dance"", a children's dance group known in the region, "" has flashing"" on the dance floor, adding to the grace and plasticity the brightness of theirs costumes and owns enthusiasm that was passed to all those who came to see and support the contestants on this important day.The jury had the opportunity to evaluate the performance of the guys from ""CANAREYKA"" original name (canary-finch) puppet theater. Although the artists themselves are not visible during the performance, they tried to convey the emotions and feelings to theirs dolls, playing as sincerely as possible so that the viewer believed in the reality of what was happening here.Christina Skrypnyk performed in the nomination ""solo performance, vocal"". Her performance fascinated the members of the jury, and it was she who passed the final selection. Art school teachers hope that our young “star” will take part in the gala concert, which will be held in the regional center (Saratov city). And we wish her good luck and we shall believe and hope in her victory in!Aida Bogdalova",art

2MhjkAbF00U,Art x Music: Sound artist Haroon Mirza and Dave Maclean (Django Django),"Sound artist Haroon Mirza discusses the relationship between fine art and electronic music with Dave Maclean, the drummer and producer of indie band Django Django who has recently remixed Mirza's sound works under the moniker of Jellyman to create a dancefloor track that has been released by The Vinyl Factory.Alongside Factory Floor who also reworked Mirza's experiments for release by The Vinyl Factory, Jellyman's remix explores the liminal space between art and music, which both Maclean and Mirza believe is more a matter of context than classification. Riffing on similar themes during this revealing conversation, Dave and Haroon discuss the role of musicians in gallery spaces, the aesthetics of Kraftwerk and Detroit techno and the ways in which Haroon's turntable experiments reflect a broader trend in DIY DJ culture to doctor and modify records to create live loops and samples.To read more about the remix collaborations and hear both tracks, click here.To order a copy of Jellyman's remix, visit our shop.",art

These surrealistic happenings have inspired most of the great show business artists.So, for the first time in France the connection , the similitude and the influence that Dali had upon Jackson will be shown.Both geniuses have suffered from the same kind of curse , the feeling of being the substitute of their born dead older brother . Effectively , after the death of a previous child , Dali’s and Jackson’s parents have decided to make another one immediately , a heavy burden to carry for the young Salvador and Michael.Dali, all along his life, talked about this trauma , which led him to this constant need of being different, of being the main attraction.Michael Jackson , though performing in a different field of art , walked the same kind of path, and also had this need to be different, even from his own brothers , this need to lead his own life and career away from “the Jackson five”.FIND MORE INFORMATION ON THIS EXHIBITION AT musee@ville-bormes.frjordipictural@gmail.comAerial view by : GregPhilobates productionfilmed by ART IN FUSION TV ELVIJS PLUGIS",art

HysDgonGMCI,Art and Music are Antidotes to Intolerance: Shubha Mudgal,"Shubha Mudgal, noted composer and singer of Hindustani classical music as well as an archivist of enterprises, has launched initiatives like www.sangeetkosh.net and www.underscorerecords.com with partner Aneesh Pradhan. Most of all a voice of resistance and protest, Shubha speaks to Communalism Combat about her personal journey. As a young student who grew up in the rich cultural and academic milieu of Allahabad, Shubha began with kathak dancing, worked as a broadcaster with All India Radio and from the proceeds of her hard earned work bought her first tanpura.  Shubha then trained in Hindustani classical music under Pandit Ramashreya Jha in Allahabad, later Pandit Vinay Chandra Maudgalya in Delhi.In this free-wheeling conversation with Teesta Setalvad, she speaks of the rich values of diversity that the Hindustani music and arts culture encapsulates, also recalling wonderful anecdotes of how leaders of the national movement like Nehru and Gandhi involved a vast array of Indians, including less visible citizens to participate in the ousting of British rule.Keen on art and music education being introduced to Indian children at a young age, she recounts how her own personal experience of these rich and diverse worlds opened doors of the mind and heart. ‘Art and music are antidotes to intolerance’ says Shubha, firmly endorsing the strong creative protests across the length and breadth of the country.Shubha Mudgal is a regular part of SAHMAT’s January 1 celebrations every year. She speaks of the transformative experience of performing there. SAHMAT was formed after the brutal killing of Safdar Hashmi twenty-six years ago. On January 1, 1989, 34 year old Safdar Hashmi, poet, playwright and political activist with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) was beaten up by hoodlums belonging to the Congress party led by Mukesh Sharma while attempting to stage a play at Jhandapur in Sahibabad. He died from his injuries the next day. SAHMAT soon emerged as a strong artist and academic collective against the voices of authoritarianism and communalism.On February 27, 2012, Shubha Mudgal performed at Gulberg Society as part of the tenth memorial of the Gujarat genocide. Her stage was the roof of a house where 19 people were killed. Those that soaked up the renderings of Shubha, Aneesh Pradhan and Sudhir Patwardhan were over 1,000 survivors of the pogrom from all over Gujarat along with human rights defenders.She ends with the vocal rendering of Sahir Ludhianvi, “Aao koi khwaab bune kal ke waste…”This is a joint production of Communalism Combat, Newsclick and Hillele.org",art

Williams College Professor Gage McWeeny (Ph.D., English and American Literature, Princeton University) has devoted part of his career to the study of twentieth century and contemporary, experimental, or conceptual writing and art. Using Sol LeWitt's wall drawings as a connection to conceptualism in literature, McWeeny sheds light on the writings of Andy Warhol, Kenneth Goldsmith, and others.David Lang, Pulitzer Prize winning composer for the ""Little Match Girl Passion"" (2008) and co-founder of the musical group Bang on a Can, will also make similar connections between Sol LeWitt's art and his own conceptualist and modernist compositions, as well as the conceptual music of Steve Reich and Tom Johnson.This lecture took place on July 18, 2013.Sol LeWitt: A Wall Drawing Retrospective is on view through 2033.",art

lDnnT5l3hHk,"Camille Paglia: Art and American Culture, Essays, History, Film, Music - Speech","Camille Anna Paglia (English: /ˈpɑːliə/; born April 2, 1947) is an American academic and social critic. Paglia has been a professor at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, since 1984.Paglia is critical of the influence modern French writers have had on the humanities, claiming that universities are in the ""thrall"" of French post-structuralists;[57] that in the works of Jean Baudrillard, Jacques Derrida, Jacques Lacan and Michel Foucault, she never once found a sentence that interested her;[58] and that post-structuralism has broken the link between the word and the thing, and thus endangers the Western canon.[59] François Cusset writes that Paglia, like other major American public intellectuals after World War II, owes her broader recognition mainly to the political repercussions of polemics that first erupted on college campuses, in her case to a polemic against foreign intellectualism. He says she achieved phenomenal success when she called Foucault a ""bastard"", thereby providing (together with Alan Sokal's Social Text parody) the best evidence for Paul de Man's view that theory should be defined negatively, based on the opposition it arouses.[60] However, Paglia's assessment of French writers is not purely negative. She has called Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex (1949) ""brilliant"", and identified Jean-Paul Sartre's work as part of a high period in literature. Paglia has praised Roland Barthes' Mythologies (1957) and Gilles Deleuze's Masochism: Coldness and Cruelty (1967), while finding both men's later work flawed. Of Gaston Bachelard, who influenced Paglia, she wrote ""[his] dignified yet fluid phenomenological descriptive method seemed to me ideal for art"", adding that he was ""the last modern French writer I took seriously"".https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille...Image By Fronteiras do Pensamento [CC BY-SA 2.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...)], via Wikimedia Commons",art

4UdhxwEZ52s,Volkswagen Light Bus Woodstock Art and Music Fair,"After more than 50 years, the iconic ‘Light’ bus—a Volkswagen Type 2 van made world famous after its appearance at the legendary 1969 Woodstock Art and Music Fair—will ride again, thanks to help from Volkswagen of America and the greater Volkswagen community. Artist Dr. Bob Hieronimus, who painted the original Light bus, will unveil a recreation of the legendary bus this weekend at the Orange Country Transporter Organization (O.C.T.O.) Winter Meet in Long Beach, California. Volkswagen fans, auto enthusiasts and art aficionados alike can view the hand-painted art piece from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 16 at Long Beach Veteran’s Memorial Stadium. This will be the first public unveiling of the replica of the Woodstock icon and the premiere stop of its scheduled cross-country tour leading up to the music festival’s 50th anniversary.The eye-popping van is the result of a three-year endeavor with Hieronimus and Canadian documentarian John Wesley Chisholm to recover and recreate the van ahead of Woodstock’s milestone anniversary. “It’s a time machine that takes people to the past, through the present and to the future,” says Chisholm.Hieronimus had painted the original 1963 Standard Microbus in 1968, after an invitation from the van’s owner, who was using it to haul his band to the festival and wanted a ‘magic bus.’ It became a symbol of the Woodstock Art and Music Fair and greater generational call for peace, love and unity after a snapshot of the van by the Associated Press was widely circulated in newspapers and magazines across the country. The van even appeared in the liner of the official Woodstock album.  While the VW bus had already been a favorite among young people seeking efficient ways to travel the country, the Light van covered with Hieronimus’s phalanx of hand-painted symbols and psychedelic shapes captured a unique moment of American culture.Originally, the pair hoped to locate and restore the original ‘Light’ bus, but after a six-month search came up empty, they decided to build a replica. Thanks to a successful Kickstarter effort, the pair was able to acquire an exact model of the original ‘Light’ bus and begin a painstaking restoration process, including a six-week effort by Hieronimus and a team of five artists to recreate the original paintings from the bus.  After learning about the project, Volkswagen of America supported the search and restoration process. A team of Volkswagen fans have also helped bring the project to fruition, offering their services and jumping in to assist the duo.#Volkswagen #VWBus #LightBus➡️ Discover all new cars before anyone else!

N0u04EqNVjo,The Art of Punk - Black Flag - Art + Music - MOCAtv,"On the first episode of ""The Art of Punk"" we dissect the art of the legendary Black Flag. From the iconic four bars symbols, to the many coveted and collected gig flyers, singles, and band t-shirts, all depicting the distinctive Indian ink drawn image and text by artist Raymond Pettibon. We start off in Los Angeles talking to two founding members singer Keith Morris, and bass player Chuck Dukowski, about what the scene was like in 1976 - setting the stage for the band's formation, as well as the bands name, and the creation of the iconic four bars symbol. Raymond Pettibon talks with us from his New York art studio. Back in LA we meet with Flea, from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, about how the art, the music, and that early LA scene impacted his own life and career. To wrap it all up we sit and talk at length, with Henry Rollins, at MOCA Grand Ave in Los Angeles, about all of the above and more. Created, directed, and Executive Produced by writer/author of 'Fucked Up + Photocopied', Bryan Ray Turcotte (Kill Your Idols), and Bo Bushnell (The Western Empire), The Art Of Punk traces the roots of the punk movement and the artists behind the iconic logos of punk bands such as: Black Flag (Raymond Pettibon), The Dead Kennedys (Winston Smith), and Crass (Dave King).In addition to profiling the artists, the series includes intimate interviews with former band members, notable artists, and celebrities who have been heavily influenced by the art of punk rock including Jello Biafra, Tim Biskup, Scott Campbell, Chuck Dukowski, Flea, Steve Olson, Penny Rimbaud, Henry Rollins, Owen Thornton, and Gee Vaucher.The filmmakers Bryan Ray Turcotte and Bo Bushnell take a unique approach to exploring the rich histories of these three seminal punk legends by focusing on the influential imagery and seeking out stories that have not been told yet through the artwork, which is integral to the importance and influence of each band.On June 11, 2013 The Art Of Punk debuts on MOCAtv with an episode on Raymond Pettibon and the artwork of Black Flag. The stories behind the art of the Dead Kennedys will debut on June 18, and June 25 will see the release of the Crass episode, all of which will be available at: www.youtube.com/MOCAtvCreated By:BRYAN RAY TURCOTTEhttps://twitter.com/bryanraymond www.KillYourIdols.comBO BUSHNELLhttps://twitter.com/BoBushnellInstagram.com/BoBushnellhttp://bobushnell.comDIRECTED BY:BRYAN RAY TURCOTTEBO BUSHNELLEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:EMMA REEVESJOHN TOBAEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:BRYAN RAY TURCOTTEBO BUSHNELLSTARRING:RAYMOND PETTIBONKEITH MORRISCHUCK DUKOWSKIHENRY ROLLINSFLEACAMERA:JOSH WEBBERBO BUSHNELLJASON BAKEREDITED BY:TIM BROOKSBEAST EDITORIALASSISTANT EDITOR:PAUL JAROLIMEKPRONERBEAST EDITORIALLOCATION SOUND:NOAH ALEXANDERCHARLES EASTMONDMOTION GRAPHIC DESIGN:BRENT STANGELMUSIC SUPERVISION:BETA PETROLMUSIC BY:RAW NERVETHEME MUSIC:SON THE FATHER by FUCKED UPCOURTESY BEGGARS GROUPADDITIONAL MUSIC BY:C.R.A.S.H.SCANNING BY:JESSE SPEARSSOUND MIXING:PHIL LANTZM SQUARED PRODUCTIONSCOLORIST:TIM BROOKSPHOTO STILLS PROVIDED BY:BRIAN TUCKERED COLVERSPOTRYAN RICHARDSONLike MOCA on Facebook: http://bit.ly/MOCAFacebookFollow MOCA on Twitter: http://bit.ly/MOCATwitter+1 MOCA on Google+: http://bit.ly/MOCAGooglePlusLike MOCA on Facebook: http://bit.ly/MOCAFacebookFollow MOCA on Twitter: http://bit.ly/MOCATwitter+1 MOCA on Google+: http://bit.ly/MOCAGooglePlusArtIsForYou20",art

It's an amazing installation a village of portable sculpture dwellings that double as musical instruments.  The walls literally make music. Musicians famous and not so famous perform concerts and then the public is invited to jam on the creations. Any one young and old can play! Airlift programming highlights our city's underground art and under-the-radar artists, transporting the dynamic street culture, living folk culture and growing contemporary arts scene of New Orleans to far-flung locations around the world for exhibitions, workshops, festivals, performances, and collaborative projects.Airlift also brings influential artists from abroad to participate in collaborative endeavors with local artists in our own community. We believe that collaboration between artists and across communities shares resources, empowers learning and unites disparate groups in common and powerful goals.New Orleans Airlift is an artist-driven initiative that collaborates and creates alongside the artists and communities we support.Airlift was founded in 2008 by musician and artist manager Jay Pennington and Delaney Martin, a multi-media installation artist, as a response to the unparalleled destruction of Hurricane Katrina and its devastating aftermath which left local artists, like all New Orleanians, struggling for their lives and livelihoods.Jay and Delaney recognized a need for new audiences who could support these artists as they rebuilt their city. They dreamt up a one-time project that took city artists to Berlin and called it The New Orleans Airlift after the Berlin Airlift of WWII. Other exchange projects that used an import/export model and a multidisciplinary approach soon followed and the name stuck.New Orleans is the last great bastion of living folk culture in the United states. Airlift projects honor tradition alongside innovation, leading our artists, culture and communities in meaningful new directions.Tweet -  @dannywolverton https://twitter.com/dannywolvertonI invite you to follow me on facebook and twitter: http://www.facebook.com/realspecialheadhttps://twitter.com/dannywolverton http://www.specialhead.comhttp://www.facebook.com/wolvertondanny Special Head LevitationHe is  best known for his appearances on America’s Got Talent in 2013 /2014 and subsequent viral videos of his Levitation acts. His America's Got talent performances were viewed by more than 40 million people on YouTube alone!""The popularity amongst Children across America following my viral appearances really inspired me, That I've been given an opportunity to be a good roll model for kids. Thats a great reason to wake up in morning"" -Wolverton""My artistic Vision is greatly influenced by my upbringing in the Native American Peyote Way Church and the Baha'i Faith. I realized that  1,000 years ago all art, performance, music, and dance was done through spiritual inspiration. The original performances were ritual and Ceremony. It wasn't until the Renaissance  that making a living through art became more widespread. Through my performances I intend to bring us back to an age of mysticism. Reminding people that performance is a ritual and that magic can be spiritual. The Special Head show goes beyond a traditional magic show. Not only does Wolverton perform Music while simultaneously performing magic illusions, Wolverton also incorporates thought provoking theatrics into his many acts. Danny uses illusions to cause the viewer to question ""what it means to be human."" His show is flexible and can be adapted to entertain many different age groups.The Anarchestra is set up as an interactive art installation that the public gets to play. It can be tuned all to the same key making it hard to hit the wrong notes. You don't have to be a good musician to play it.

The potential of mandalas has been known in Eastern cultures for centuries. Considered to be highly complex maps of the cosmos, mandalas are symbolic spiritual images which, when meditated on, can bring about profound inner transformation. Unravel a mysteries of unconscious self by making your own during a relaxation session.“The mind is a mandala, a circle. If you watch, you become aware of the vicious circle of the mind. Again and again it brings the same emotions – the same anger, the same hatred, the same greed, the same ego. And you are just a victim. Becoming aware of the mind, you break the circle, you are no more identified with the mind.”– Osho▶ Subscribe Zen Meditation Planet Channel to get more inspiration!Subscribing to our channel will keep you up-to-date on our new developments, as we are also growing not only in the number of the videos, but also in the ideas we wish to share and experience we gather along the way!▶ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1Cz...Contact us on following social media platforms:☑️ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ZenMeditatio...☑️ Twitter: https://twitter.com/Zen_PlanetThe background music used in this HQ video comes from the album:Healing Nature Relaxation 50 Tracks – Relaxing Track, Balancing Nature Music, Spa Music, Zen Massage, Nature Ambience by Nature Sounds Universe🎵 Google Play Store link: https://play.google.com/store/music/a...🎵 iTunes Store link: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/hea...",art
bxhPwMNZpgY,Wingmakers Music & Art,"There is something about this artwork and music  that touches one's soul. This particular piece (as with the others found at the Ancient Arrow site) is very busy, almost overwhelming to the eye.  I have tried to break it down for the eye and then put it back together again. The idea behind the paintings is that there is meaning in the symbols and there is communication that is going on at a deeper (subconscious?) level than we may readily perceive with our limited senses. The meaning of this piece is left up to the viewer and that is how it is and should be with all good art /music and myth I might add.  The work, for me, has spiritual meaning, yet if I was asked to tell you what exactly this piece is about, I could not. There is something sensual here to my ears and eyes, a multi-course feast (if you will) that the Creator (James?)  has brought together. This art and music is rumored to be from 'another universe.' It is modified (or somewhat diluted)  from the original because we don't have the same capabilities to perceive it display it and/or recreate it that the beings who created it have developed over eons. For instance, it is said that the pictures move or come alive when viewed in the individual chambers where they were found. Few have witnessed it . It is music and art that supposedly activates long dormant parts of our DNA, DNA that was intentionally genetically manipulated or altered by beings from other parts of the universe many thousands of years ago. Some on earth might have called them ""gods."" This is an ongoing, unfolding project designed by it's creators, the Lyricus teaching order, to open us up to dimensions we have here-to-fore not experienced. I am told we are now on the threshold of being ready for at least part of the information it can impart. The music and art here are from the Ancient Arrow site see: www.wingmakers.com also see www.Lyricus.org.",art

UaLjVRRIsW8,Art and Music Classes,"These are snippets from the classes I'm taking this semester in art and music.  The first image is of my first completed art project for my Drawing 1 class, which turns out to be quite a bit more than that.  The materials I used  are coffee stain, ink, charcoal pencils and conte crayons.  The video following is a lecture on how to harmonize a melody with a I V7 expanding progression from my classical Music Theory II class.  It involves the study of solfege.  First we transcribe by ear from my teacher's playing of the bass and melody on the piano. Then, with his help, we arrange it for four voices according to the rules of the common practice as shown in the video.  Sorry about the shaky camera. I kept reaching for my pencil and trying to take notes at the same time.  Old habits die hard.",art

Larghetto (1:51:36)Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (27 January 1756 – 5 December 1791) was a prolific and influential composer of the classical era.Born in Salzburg, Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court, but grew restless and traveled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his early death at the age of 35. The circumstances of his early death have been much mythologized.He composed more than 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music.

P5kHf0LhIm8,How to be Creative - Developing Creativity - Art Music Writing etc.,"How to be Creative - Developing Creativity and Productivity - Art Music Writing etc.In this video, I talk about how to be creative and create better projects by using two different types of thinking. For creative insights, I recommend what I call creative mod. Then, when you actually create, you go into editing mode. But it's important not to mix up these two thought processes.Creativity and productivity are the two things needed to create a work of art. Many people spend forever in creative mode where new creative insights come up, but they never develop the productivity skills to bring those ideas to the world. On the other side, there are people who have created such a rigid system for creation that the editing related tasks completely nullify the ability for creative insights to come about. This process should work with many different art forms including but not limited to:DrawingPaintingSculptureWriting Video CreationAnimationDesignFilmMusicetc.",art

Thank you so much to the community for the support and kind words, they mean the absolute world to me!Original music for #GeekandSundry's #CriticalRoleSO this piece took research to pull off, I'd read that Matt had based a lot of Wildemount's culture off of real life Eastern European examples and I remember hearing a while back that his favourite instrument was violin so I implemented a mix of Eastern European folk music (Polish, Hungarian, etc.) into a very rhythmic orchestral. I'd started this piece a few days prior to the first episode so the fact that they're using music from the Witcher series actually coincides quite well with this. You may have noticed but I also worked Jason Charles Miller's original main theme into the ending and a violin passage mixed in with my own theme. I'll go into a more in depth analysis if enough people want to know how this was made.",art
